## We've Adjusted Margin Requirements on Certain Securities

Due to recent market activity, we've adjusted margin requirements on certain securities. Please note, neither Charles Schwab &amp; Co. nor TD Ameritrade halted clients from buying any stocks, or selling any stocks they own, and neither firm restricted executing any basic options strategies. However, we've raised margin requirements on the following securities. We'll keep this list updated with the latest information.

* **AMC, GME\***

**The following requirements are in place for affected securities:**

* Stocks:
   * 100% margin requirement for long positions.
   * 300% margin requirement for short positions.
* Long calls, long puts, and covered calls are permitted.
* Selling short put options is permitted if you have available funds to cover the entire amount of the exercise.\*\*
* Selling naked calls is prohibited.

We continue our commitment to help investors better understand what's behind these moves and how to navigate the market impact.",1

198,"Yeah, so I think I'm getting naked puts and naked calls a little mixed up. Naked calls have potentially unlimited loss since you don't already own those shares and you may have to purchase shares at market price to sell to the call option buyer at their strike. Naked puts, while not unlimited loss potential, still carry significant the further the share price drops and in theory could drop to zero. So if you sell a naked put, the most you'll be out I guess is the strike price x 100 (for one contract) and you'll need at least that much in your account to cover it. If the strike is $50 and the share price of XYZ company continues to fall to say $30 and gets exercised, then you'd have to buy those shares at $50 so you can sell them for $30 to the put option buyer which means you're taking a loss of $20 per share, i.e., $2000 total.

I think that's right anyway. This shit confuses me. lol",1

- Trust the DD (providing some below)

Shipping companys going for [slow steaming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slow_steaming) to reduce fuel consumption drastically, so it really depends on how much fuel those ships have. Also going the detour won't guarantee you good spot in the queue for the ports. You waste a ton of time while other ships take the normal route and be in front of you.

That way you get all the benefits of rising stock plus rising IV and you’re not sitting around getting IV crushed by morning dips and slowly eaten away by theta,1

1116,"CHASE LIMITATIONS:

TL;DR Be very familiar with the trading restrictions on your trading platform so you are not caught off guard and delayed (or canceled) when executing your exit strategy. Some restrictions were never applicable to us because we trade in relatively low dollar amounts. 

I lurked on Reddit forever with ZERO intention of ever posting. I found this sub by accident and I couldn’t be more thankful that I did. The information shared here has helped me to find a clarity of thought and intention that I never dreamed possible.

When I read some of the due diligence here, and the absolutely stunning depth of knowledge shared, I’ve never felt dumber... Some of you are simply brilliant. As an airline pilot flying globally on the 777 I have to have my crap together. I’m a pretty squared away guy, but it’s humbling being here. I truly appreciate your efforts.

ANYWAY....  Something I feel everyone needs to familiarize themselves with BEFORE the squeeze starts is the possible restrictions placed on your ability to sell in large dollar amounts on your trading platform.

After reading copious amounts of data and beginning to plan my strategy, I found out that even as a Chase Private Client customer, I am restricted from selling above certain dollar amounts and numbers of shares (which I’ll share in a bit).

I am fortunate enough to be able to think about exiting  in blocks of 100 shares well into the 6-figure per-share price range.  Or so I thought...

Thankfully I found out that Chase will send certain trades through their “trading desk” for their “review” (instead of just immediately executing the trades as they’ve done with every trade I’ve made since opening my brokerage accounts). That WILL delay the execution of your trade.

The Chase restrictions on online trades are:

Chase will route all trades (market and limit) above 25,000 shares and/or $1M through their trading desk, which could possibly delay your trade a few minutes or MUCH LONGER depending on how busy they are. Think about what a disaster that could be if you are selling AFTER we peak.

The second (and even worse) restriction is: Any trade for 100,000 shares and/or $3M will be outright rejected and you’ll just get an error message... Imagine the frustration you’d feel if the price is declining and every second is costing you money as you try to figure out what’s happening... (which is why it’s important to have your plan, AND ALL CONTINGENCIES, in place before the squeeze)

Originally I intended to sell in blocks of 100 shares but each of those transactions would’ve been in the 10’s of millions of dollars each.

I’ve had to adjust my strategy to stay within the parameters of the Chase restrictions...  Unless the price per share goes above $1M, I’m going to trade the requisite number of shares to keep the transactions below $1M each.  If the price goes above that (and I haven’t been a paper-handed bitch and cashed them all out) I’ll be on the phone with Chase getting it done.

Best of luck.

I like the idea of a charitable trust, but I would like to make sure it goes to folks who need it and not bonuses, raises, and parties for the people running the show. For example, I met a young veteran and his pregnant wife living in their van until they could find a place to live. His cardboard sign was ""I'll work for food.""  As a veteran myself, I talked to him about his service, and he had the correct answers so I figured he was legit.  Getting him in contact with the right people got him and his wife out of the van and back on their feet, with a little cash in their pocket until the paycheck came in.

I've been told that big charities can make the donations go further. I'm not so sure. I watched a number of TED Talk pods where ""I get paid xxxmillion dollars a year because I bring in xxxxxxxxxxmillions to the charity.""  Okay, I get it: you're a rich person living off my $25 donation.

1437,"&gt;There are securities laws at federal and state level that govern this, even internationally. An analysts role is to do an analysis and publish reports on valuations, including assumptions and the whole bang shoot. They’re supposed to be objective and have an iron wall between them and the marketing people and overall leadership who are making investment decisions with other people’s money.

There are laws that govern the exchange of information between departments in a company. For example the M&amp;A dept talking to CompanyX about an acquisition can't disclosed that information to the investment fund dept that recommends equities to clients, that would be insider trading.

However, as far as I am aware there are no laws stating that an analyst's price targets can't be communicated by a companies CEO once they are published and in the public domain. The whole point of an analyst is to make a prediction and for the company, other companies and general public use that how they wish as a guide for investments. 

Can you provide a source for the securities laws you're referring to? I would be quite interested to see what is written down on this subject.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Imagine if the CEOs of Barclays, City Group, JP Morgan, Roth Capital, Bernstein or Gordon Johnson would go all over social media and tweet that Tesla is 60 to 90% over priced in the market.

They might not get on twitter but they do interviews where they make broad market predictions that can move entire sectors. Many CEOs have come out and said  ""we see the price of oil/gold/the dollar increasing over the next X months/years"". Larry Flink CEO of BlackRock ($8T AUM) recently said they are changing their investment strategy towards climate change  and sustainability, that moved the green energy sector in its entirety. 

&amp;#x200B;

&gt; One, it would be extremely unprofessional for them to do so

How unprofessional is it for Josh Brown who is CEO of Ritholtz Wealth Management to be on CNBC every day talking prices and predictions? I'm honestly not getting where this unprofessional stance is coming from.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;But to put their opinion on it would, in my opinion, be breaking the ethics code

Warren Buffet, the most influential investor of many generations recently said that Berkshire Hathaway overpaid for their investment in Kraft Heinz, is this also an ethical violation? I don't see it. CEOs, anybody for that matter, can make their opinion known on any subject as long as the information they are communicating is pubic knowledge and not based on inside information that is subject to NDA. 

Or are you saying that the CEO of investment fund should never be allowed to talk about their investments, predictions, targets or holdings...even if all of this information is freely public in their filings?",0

I think we're going to see a bit of both today, but that, on the whole, we'll be down.

&gt; The Fund has licensed as its Underlying Index the S-Network Space Index which is designed to measure the performance of companies engaged in space-related industries. A company is considered to be in a space-related business if its product(s) either has as its essential purpose — or is dependent upon — space-based functions (the revenue produced by space related companies is referred to as “space revenues). In the case of companies that make products that go into space (such as launch vehicles), or companies that operate systems in space (such as satellites), the space-related nature of the business is clear. For companies whose products and services are solely used on the surface of the Earth, space must play an essential role in the business in order to be classified as “space-related”. For example, a GPS smartwatch is not a viable product without its GPS satellite connectivity, while a car with GPS navigation can still serve its basic function without that space-related perk.",0

What is the biggest thing holding EV adoption back? Batteries. The company that solves this could be responsible for shifting everything to EV.

Have people read the description of Ecellix's eCell technology? Ecellix is Romeo's strategic partner. My gut feeling is that Ecellix can do what QS is claiming, and they are way ahead of QS considering they are working with Romeo to get their cells tested and moving forward with packing. They must be working on packing their cells already if they went ahead with partnering with Romeo. Ecellix just does not call it ""Solid state battery"". In fact, QS is not completely solid state. They use liquid to some extent. If Romeo/Excellix can move trucks, then it would be a cake to move passenger cars. With BorgWarner backing up Romeo, it will turn VW's vision upside down. GM, Ford, etc will come to BorgWarner/Romeo/Ecellix. Guess who would want it the most even if it has to pay high price. FISKER

Fourth quarter Net Loss was $298.3 million, compared to Net Income of $15.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. Fourth quarter Net Margin was (194.3%). The loss was primarily due to a $296.7 million year-over- year increase in stock-based compensation expense and payroll tax expense related to stock-based compensation, including $285.3 million related to the non-recurring Co-Chief Executive Officers’ awards made in connection with the IPO. The loss was also due to a $41.7 million non-cash non-recurring charge related to a charitable stock donation in support of our philanthropic endeavours. We committed to this donation at the time of our IPO and executed on it in the fourth quarter.

If you want to day trade it’s worth learning, but a dangerous game. Look around TradingView, there are very few consistent contributors. Very often TA can just reaffirm confirmation bias seeing patterns that don’t exist. For example, if you don’t like a daily MA move the chart hourly, weekly, whatever you’ll eventually find a way to fit the data to your opinion.

My 2 cents is never rely on one indicator, get a read on overall sentiment, and have stop losses. A lot of the time day trading you might be buying in at near ATH prices to scalp the last bit of the ride up. It’s imperative not to become a bag holder at the peak.",0

My tax attorney told me IRS does not give you a break if they feel they can collect from you in your life time.

So if you own home that has equity they will force you to use the equity to pay for it.

All I gotta say to new traders is have a 31-day gap in the year you have a wash sale on a ticker and don't trade that ticker in January of 2022 - that's it...

Simple rul but a lot of us missed it.

FYI: trading volume doesn't matter. You can trade 500M and have 0 profit.

How? Buy 300 shares of tesla in and out 10 to 20 scalps a day,, and you've already hit 3.9M in volume....

It's the wash sale rule that gets everyone.",0

1992,"my personal experience and my personal opinion: 

&amp;#x200B;

I follow stocks almost daily. I ´ve been dabbling / Investing for a good portion of 20 years now. 

I´ve seen plenty of times where patterns from TA were indeed working.

I have only recently added a pattern indicator in my tradeview account and almost all sell / buy signals on all stocks I did test runs with were right, most of the time. (lets say about 75% of the time.

yet I always have t remember:   
\- only about 10% of acutal daytraders (professional , educated and informed traders) beat the market consistently. 

\- not even 10% of Forex traders make actual profit conistently.

daytraders and forex traders seem to rely heavily on TA as they rarely stay long enough into any investment to make FA even worthwile to spend time on. 

So I draw my own conclusions on this: if it would be working and would be more reliable, the yields of traders would be much muich higher than they are in reality. again, I am talking consistent , long term profits. not having a few good weeks, months or even years. 

&amp;#x200B;

so, I love to be able to at least know what is happening. but I would never bet more than my usual risk tolerance level on any single security simply because a TA indicator seems to be right.",0

(b) This is not over and credit Suisse and Nomura have to dump a few billion more in stocks, a few more stocks are going to drop hard, but then this ends

(c) the b scenario happens, but other hedge funds are over leveraged and the sell off means that they get margin called and then they have to sell which leads to other firms getting margin called etcetera etcetera, and Archegos becomes the 2021 version of Lehman Brothers who crashed and helped start the 2008 market collapse",0

Took me a while but i finally accepted i can not beat the market and that i do not want the burden or responsibility of buying countless stocks to do so and having to watch them. Its not a 3 fund boglehead but here is my 5 fund Portfolio.

28 years old. 15-20 year portfolio to pay for kids colleges not looking for high risk. 

VTI- 77%

SCHD- 5% 

SMH- 5%

QQQM- 5%

QQQJ- 5%

VB- 3% 



I know everyone's going to say add VXUS. I just am not convinced itll do well. However it if has a major correction (on the graph its had quite a hot run 2020 to 2021) then id buy. If i did it wouldn't be more than 5% weight MAYBE 10%. 

I have thought about increasing VB to 5% for a slightly bigger small cap tilt since all the other funds lack there. 

Ive also considered increasing SCHD to 10% since its dividend and in a way a reopening play with the holdings it have. 

I think there is a case for QQQM &amp; QQQJ to both be 10% each but thats a heavy tech tilt which is why i chose 5% each.

@OP, one good way of looking at it is that you trust the firm you're investing in with your money, so rather than have it pay out profits to you, you allow them to reinvest those profits to grow the company.

3316,"I’m an amateur investor, so I was hoping someone else would give a more clear response, but seeing that no one has brought up my take on the matter, here’s my take.

TLDR: It’s for future dividends. “Growth stocks” can pay even bigger dividends later if they reinvest profits now. Investors can account for that.

(Technically companies also have assets they use to run operations and these are worth something, but since average PoB is around 3, if stocks are actually fairly priced [and if I understand PoB correctly and have made correct assumptions about how net assets are valued], ≈2/3 of a stocks price must come from somewhere else.)

The Read: Any company with profit can make a decision whether to pay out that profit to owners, or to reinvest in growth. When making this decision I’d expect a company to evaluate whether future profits will increase by more than the amount reinvested when measured in current value, (i.e. they try to take into account the time value of money, inflation and whatever else,)and then make the decision that maximizes long term profit. I see this as being related to TAM (total addressable market) vs what I will call CAM (currently addressed market.) 

The closer CAM is to TAM the more the business can only grow by taking customers from competitors, but since these companies could throw away all their money on marketing wars and not grow significantly or at all, they won’t want that outcome as much and are more likely to pay out dividends. Why put out energy into fighting over the size of a slice of pie if everyone’s slice is just going to stay the same?Example: REIT’s US Telecom

If CAM &lt;&lt; TAM then companies can grown without as much competition. Companies may choose to continuously reinvest in themselves, but eventually if CAM approaches TAM it becomes the previous case. Because there’s a lot more money to be made for everyone involved the companies aren’t fighting for their slice of the pie, they’re making a bigger pie. Example: eCommerce

Reading the comments I felt like there were a lot of “because stonks go up comments,” and while barring an enormous change to the world I think this is true, that same line of thought justifies investing in Ponzi schemes and bubbles. The former illegal (I couldn’t cite a specific law, but I think I’ve been told it is) and both effective ways of losing wealth (which I think is actually closer you were getting at.) I take it as a reminder that people don’t need all the details to be successful at something (in this case making money in the stock market,) but also that people giving advice don’t always have that many details (which means taking their advice could be a big mistake)",0

Losses mount no matter how much money they get for years with very little to show for. If a company or any individual is asking for a larger sum of money every year with shills talk about how their big plan is gonna help everyone, yet their track record shows every spending project ended up way over the budget, they would be laugh off and be considered as scammer.

It is illegal to claim it as revenue and consequently to claim a deduction on something that does not count as revenue is tax fraud.

If you bought in at the high thinking its going to continue, well of it crashes your losing 4x your money.  If T crashes again your losing half? Maybe? But while you sit and wait your getting 7% so lets say for example 2-4 years for a real crash thats 14-28% youve almost crash proofed yourself and thats assuming you went to sleep on the stock market and waited to sell at the bottom.  My idea isnt to wait that long, to get out at some point then wait and jump into something with lots of growth potential.  Not to ride the crash back up inside a dividend stock.  But if your in a aristocrat dividend stock the chances of them removing the dividend are lower so thats still a potential play.

3532,"What makes you think they won't crash with the rest? I think being concrete matters, here. A dividend stock could stop paying a dividend during a general crash. That's what happened with many of the air lines stocks. Also, many of them DO follow the market down WITHOUT following the market up. Look at T, as an example - in 2008 T took a dive with the rest of the market and went from $40 to $20. But while the rest of the market recovered and went to an all time high, T is still at $30 today. That's a terrible return for investment if you just held through the crash, even with the 7% dividend, because the rest of the market is up like 200%.

3569,"I don't know much about the fundamentals of Disney, so take this with a grain of salt, but one thing I do know a lot about is Star Wars, and I can just tell you I saw their price surge when they released their list of shows and thought... ""Why?""

Mando generated a lot of buzz when it was released initially because star wars fans were excited about a live action star wars show, plus they had a strong beginning which attracted mainstream viewers. But now that their initial story which was established in the first episode is over, I really don't think as many people are going to care about the third. Shows retain audiences with memorable characters that the audience feels something for, Mandolorian has none of those, every character seems copy and pasted from an algorithm

Boba Fett and Kenobi, again, might generate some buzz because all the star wars fans are going to be excited. But just like with the Mandalorian, I don't think they'll actually be good shows, they'll be something that your girlfriend will fall asleep to while you try to explain all the lore and references to her.

Now, just by itself, that would make me not necessarily bearish, but just, not really bullish either. But there's like 7 more star wars shows they are making. I think almost all are going to flop. Disney just has no idea how to do star wars. I have no idea how that affects the stock price, I don't have an opinion on it being a buy or a hold, but I would factor it in your decision that Disney is killing at least of their golden geese by continuously releasing cash grab shows containing nothing but fan service",0

Also if you want another good site to check out charities, check out GiveWell. They do super indepth analysis of tons of charities worldwide to determine which ones do the most with your money. If your goal, for instance, is to lengthen human lives by as much as you can per dollar, their spreadsheet will tell you the top ones for that. If you want to specifically reduce diseases that cause the most suffering, or things that affect certain groups, or locations, you can make all of those things factors too and give them whatever weight you want in the analysis, and then they'll use those weights to figure out the most effective charities for your goal. Fucking amazing organization.

But I just sold it to buy  stocks for companies that will profit from infrastructure (Biden to announce that plan shortly).

GOOGL went down 3.5%. My infrastructure stocks went up 10%.

When infrastructure stocks are overvalued, I will sell those stocks and rebuy GOOGL (assuming it's at the right price).",0

""Don't time the market"" is bad advice just like ""stocks always go up"".

Ostensibly both are very valid ideas to understand. How you use those ideas is what's most important.

Trying to time the market by doing a day trade on a volatile stock based on the fact that you think a merger is happening this week = dumb.

Trying to time the market by selling off your stocks and hedging cash while buying inverse ETFs when you recognize overwhelming evidence that a correction is coming = smart.

Just buying stocks and holding them forever isn't a nuanced approach. Oddly, people take this weird pride in it like holding is brave or a testament to character. It becomes emotional which is deadly.

I find all that very puzzling. The NASDAQ has had more down days than up days over its history. People want to restrict making money to half of the time instead of all of the time. 

I'm not a bear or a bull. I'm a guy who does what is best to make money. Sometimes that's buy and hold, sometimes that's cut and run.",0
3989,"&gt;That’s why I feel that active stock picking with a very long time horizon is more dangerous,

It seems, based on your own examples, that active stock picking with a very long time horizon is more dangerous *if you pick stocks that are doing very well right now*. If you assume Amazon will be around forever and just park your money there for 20 years, by your argument, this is a bad idea. But buying a newer company that you are very bullish on over a longer time horizon may not be a bad idea precisely for that reason. It's the difference between betting on Sony in 1995 because ""the Walkman is everywhere"" vs. betting on Apple in that same year because you see it as the future.",0

4823,"When you move assets as ""in-kind"" (which is a typical transfer), you get to keep the shares you bought at your cost basis. Bear in mind that your RH account will be locked for the duration (standard procedure), so you can only buy/sell in your new brokerage account. RH charges a $75 transfer fee, but Fidelity and Vanguard typically (I think) cover it on their end; either way make sure you have $75 ready in your bank account just in case.

The additional issue is that Robinhood is on a backlog of sending brokers your cost-basis (apparently too many people transferred out, so they are behind their work), so your cost basis will be wrong for a while. They are legally obliged to send your broker the correct cost basis in time (up to a month iirc), though.

I believe (someone correct me if I am wrong) however, that the information reported on your tax form 1099 should be correct in the end, but the information on your new brokerage account will be incorrect for a while until RH gets off their asses. It's a small downside for peace of mind though, I think.

You can manually request an update to your cost basis, but afaik you'll have to provide Fidelity and Vanguard with the exact cost of all the shares (each share has a unique ID).",1

It's wildly rare that charities spend 5% or less on the programs. 

It's also very very rare for charities to be purely fraudulent, though I'm sure it happens. All financials are public info, so it seems to be a very dumb way to commit fraud.

This is a term of pure propaganda. It means nothing useful. All states are authoritarian, but on behalf of whom and against whom do they wield their authority?

When Gamestop reversed course due to Ryan Cohen/Blackrock intervention and promotion of the stock by Keith Gill, the stock rose and forced a margin call on Melvin.  
&amp;nbsp;  
However, the reported SI is still over 100% float; and it is *suspected* by the proponents of a GME squeeze that the hedge funds holding shorts have been shorting to cover shorts and hiding these shorts through various means (dark pool trading, abuse of reporting windows to cover synthetic shorts, etc).

The ideal stock to hold is a solid company at a great price.  There are lots of great companies but it can take patience and luck to buy at a great price.

To be honest the way I have it now, I did a major overhaul of my Roth earlier this year so I’m basically slightly overweight REITs compared to where I’ll end up based on my contributions and some basic calculations. I’ve overshot it slightly but over the year it’ll adjust back to where I want it, about 15%. I’m a believer in REITs and overall I have a fairly barbell approach, with a decent bifurcation between “growth” and “value/income”. I don’t like to describe them as such because my growth names have great FCF generation already, they just don’t pay a dividend. And likewise my value/income names are still growing and in some cases (some REITs) in very aggressive expansion mode. So it’s overall very nuanced, but either way most of my money is in TSM and an international allocation.

The target is to buy stocks which have a lot of potential growth in price.

Have you had any losses at all within the last 30 days?

Investopedia: 
“A wash sale occurs when an investor sells or trades a security at a loss, and within 30 days before or after, buys another one that is substantially similar. It also happens if the individual sells the security at a loss, and their spouse or a company they control buys a substantially similar security within 30 days.”",0

But 5% of $400K is $20K. That $20K could be the entire salary of a non profit worker that's not a CEO. So each year, the CEOs are trying to make more than the CEO next to them, not considering the downstream effects. Before you know it, CEOs are getting yearly raises, bonuses, and other compensation worth way more to the rest of society, but they only see it as a marginal benefit to them. As a result, CEO and executive pay runs rampant at little to no benefit to the actual charity under the guise that it's fair because other CEOs with runaway salary's are making that much. Another way to think about it is, what is the marginal value of a 5% raise to someone making $20K a year vs. $200K a year. Now, what is $10k to someone making $20K a year vs someone making $200K a year. OR, what is $10K toward the actual mission of the charity, if it's, say a food bank, that's a hell of a lot of canned goods and non perishables.

When you buy stock you’re buying a piece of the business, so when the company goes from making say 1b $ a year to making 10b $, who cares if they pay dividends if they’re growing the business at a rapid rate. I would rather own 1% of a business when it’s 1b company and hold it for say 5 years until it’s a 10b company then collect a modest 2-3% annual dividend with little to no appreciation in the businesses value. 

For me I don’t care about dividends at all at this point in my life (I’m only 20), but if I was nearing retirement then I would opt more for the passive income.

I was in a huge hole,  but my research had me understand it was going to work.  I continued to add to lower my cost basis,  and made out really well on it.  My point is..... it seems like online there's a need for instant gratification.  I would've been crucified when it dropped under 2$ in 2016 for years if I posted pumps about it on reddit.  but the return I have in it now is a return people would only wish they could get over a few years.

Option 1: you take the profit (dividend), pax tax, and repeat the next year the same cycle.

Option 2: you take $10,000 and buy one more field (growth). Then next year you get $20,000 from both fields and you buy 2 more fields, and so on.

Now ask yourself, at the end of 5 years - what will be your equity from these two options.

Option 1: you enjoyed your dividend but your farm costs the same and you will receive the same amount year after year, plus you had to pay income tax every year.

Secondly isn't Tesla more than a car company? Don't they do things with energy and insurance as well? Not to mention bitcoin now (that's a different story).

There's already waiting lists for their $120M lithography machines into late 2022/early '23. 
* AMD (AMD) - Intel's recent product gaps have given AMD time to step up. Even with the new leadership at Intel, it's unlikely that they will maintain market share dominance to the same extent over the next decade, and that's a massive available market for AMD to continue growing within.

Libertarians generally love charity as it's all voluntary. The belief is why should a government provide food to the needy by ""force"" if a charity could and all money is given voluntarily?

5777,"You're just considering dividends though, the real cost is the capital gains on the appreciation. Over a very long term investment that grew a lot the majority of what you sell it for will be taxable. For example if you invest $10k now, and in 10-20 years its worth 100k, in a taxable account you will have to pay long term capital gains tax on $90k which could be over $20k depending on your income and state. In a retirement account you don't have to pay that. There is also the potential advantage of deferring income tax, but the 401k / IRA limits are so low now the only really big benefit will be if you get a really big appreciation of what you put in there. Like Mitt Romney's 100 million IRA.",0
5778,"It doesn't matter what order you buy/sell.

The IRS sees that you bought shares at 3 distinct times, and 2 of those times qualify as ""previous 30 days"".

the wash sale rule says that if you sell at a loss, and you bought additional shares any time in the previous or next 30 days, you can't claim the loss.

When you sold batch #1, you had already bought 3 batches prior to that sale. (This is the part that is probably tripping you up)

If you had bought all of those shares in one transaction (instead of 3), then you could claim the total loss without doing the special wash sale calculation

&amp;#x200B;

e.g. You buy $40, $30, $20

stock is now $10, and you sell everything in 3 sell transactions.

You sell the $40 for a $30 loss. This $30 loss gets added to your cost basis of the remaining shares ($30+20)+$30 = $80 for the remaining 2 shares.

You sell the $30 for a $20 loss. The $20 loss gets added to your cost basis of the remaining share ($20 share) +$30 (loss from previous sale) + $20 loss here = $70 cost basis for the final share.

Now you sell the final $20 share for $10. and your net is $10-$70 (wash sale cost basis from line above) = $60 loss.

so in the end, the loss is correct, but the order they add/subtract is not what you're used to.",0

7234,"&gt;yes, they're MMs, not fund managers pumping their own stocks - surely you see the difference?

ARK saying TSLA to $3000 vs  Jefferies upgraded GME from $15 to $175 last week, that's a 1000% price target increase. Jefferies happens to own 1% of GME and is also handling a potential stock sale of $100 million for them.

MMs publish price targets on their holdings and funds publishing theirs. What's the difference?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Fund analyst != fund owner/CEO

Off the top of my head I can think of Josh Brown who is CEO of Ritholtz Wealth Management and Stephen Weiss who founded and is a managing partner of  Short Hills Capital Partners. Both are regulars on CNBC's Fast Money and talk daily about individual stocks, their holdings and their price predictions. Cathie Wood is in the exact same role as these guys, they are CEO/CIOs and analysts. 

What exactly is the difference between a fund analyst getting on CNBC and saying ""TSLA to $3000 based on our analysis"" vs a CEO/CIO saying ""TSLA to $3000 based on our analysis"". Why would one be a conflict of interest and not the other?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;You ever heard Warren Buffet putting price targets on coca cola or Ray Dalio talking to the media about the price WMT or Alibaba will hit?

I've heard Dalio talk prices, he recently advocated for the increasing price of gold, which his hedge fund is heavily invested in. His co-CIO Jensen then came out in Feb and said gold could hit $2000. Nothing wrong with them saying that in my opinion, but that could easily be construed as them pimping their position. 

Buffet is different, he doesn't do targets, charts or patterns, he said that in one of his recent BRK letters. However he will freely make commentary on his holdings, he talked about KHC an interview last year saying that they should pay down debt and maintain the present dividend and that they paid too much for the company. Essentially saying that the stock price was too high.

The American system has a mix of private and public bodies with separate, often conflicting, agendas. It relies on private auditors and public regulators with varying degrees of autonomy, power, and decency. There are several places where this system fails and is in need of improvement, and has improved in the past in fits and starts. Therefore the Securities Act of 1933, Sarbanes-Oxley, Dodd-Frank, and a thousand other minor course corrections. It’s not going to be perfect or devoid of corruption or revolving doors, but it adapts and does not play to the tune of a single agenda. It’s a lot like democracy.

The Chinese system, on the other hand, has no notion of autonomous oversight or independent audit whatsoever. Whatever the state wants, will be delivered. An American President who wanted the market to go in a specific direction or data to be misrepresented outright would have to contend with a whole structure of independent people who don't mind following their own interests. The last American President tried a much milder version of that, and got burned for it in all directions. In America, ‘state interest’ directing all things is an anomaly and one the system actively rebels against; in China, it is the system.

It’s fashionable (edgy?) to equate the two systems, especially for Americans who have never encountered a truly authoritarian, monolithic system that has no compunction using violence for its ends on all occasions. They are not.",0

Equities as an entire asset class are very high risk compared to other investments like government bonds, or a savings account like you've already mentioned.

Each of the above show how inefficient markets are. There are lots of forces moving stock prices, and players are not even necessarily motivated in always paying the fair price. Some strategies are in fact based on totally ignoring fundamentals, exploiting trends, inflating inefficiencies and attacking someone else’s weakness.",0

7393,"Now that's an interesting perspective! To me, investing in the Chile IPSA index looked as the most diversified thing I could do, since it's an index it doesn't depend or on the success of a particular company or economic sector. But as a whole, betting on Latin America is risky, even if it's ""the entire country"" for me, I can understand it being kind of a Casino play for americans.

I'm not scared of high risk plays, I've been reading investment books and guides for a long time even before I started for the first time. I know I should be thinking long run and all, but isn't 5 years enough waiting? Literature usually mentions 3-4 years as a good benchmark tool for measuring long-term oriented investments. For me it's been more than that and I'm 17% down.

The wording in your reply (emphasis on the *timing* part) makes me think that you believe my assets should recover eventually, is that so? I wouldn't mind waiting an extra 2 years to be back at +0%, but the trend seems to be that every time i put all of my month's work into a fund, I lose money. Do you think IPSA/$ECH will eventually recover, being a high risk investment and all? Or will it stay in its trend to $0 and i'd be better of withdrawing the losses and going into something else? 

I insist, i have NO issue with high risk plays, I just find it weird that after 5 years of waiting, i'm so much in the red, and that the moment after i invest in tech stocks, they go down HARD.",0

I can’t speculate on near term value,  could climb to premerger 40-50s or stay in this value range if EV doesn’t become more established.

When you “give” this amount to corporations, they make the donation so they get this credit they can apply to their income tax payable. 

To make it easier to understand, the person/ entity who donates the money to the charity directly is the one who receives the credit. So when you round up, you’re indirectly donating and the corporation is directly donating. 

No one is in the wrong for donating. Yes, to you, your $0.11 donation does not matter as a tax write off because you’ll probably not even save $0.01 from taxes. But on the corporate end, if 1M people donated that amount, it adds up and they can save a lot of money.",0

To me it seems clear that Ark truly believes in their analysis of Tesla’s potential share price in five years. Whether you agree with them or not seems a better place to stake an argument than saying that a fund shouldn’t be transparent about what they believe the value proposition for one of their holdings is. 

So if you have a problem with the evaluation sark is offering on TSLA, that’s great. That’s your prerogative. I just roll my eyes at the accusations of impropriety or foul play.",0

OK, there it is.

No one's saying you have to go to college. It's debatable and that's its own conversation, but listen to what these people are saying about investing in yourself and don't forget to value an income. Investing makes a great ""side-hussle"" but if it's trading you're interested in, that's probably different, I don't really know much about it. Last thing I'll say is that of course this is something that appeals to you. It feels so damn good to make money doing nothing. We would all do it if we could. Is your aspiration to be so detail oriented and up to date on every rumor to have a real edge? How will a gap year earn back the opportunity cost of not pursuing something else for a year? Can you do this AND other things simultaneously?

Sure, the hard cap with constant demand would absolutely cause a rise in price. Does demand stay constant in the future? It could increase as supply hits its cap causing a massive surge in price.

Just like a drop in demand would cause a decrease in price.

Most of my friends parents invest in real estate and they keep getting richer and richer and housing keeps getting more and more expensive, it's ridiculous. I live in Santiago, Chile, and it would take \~120 months of my entire income to buy a 17m\^2 apartment in the suburbs. That's one of the reason i don't want to move from my parent's house just yet.

I can't find the source right now, but chileans real-estate/stock investing ratio is much, MUCH greater than in other countries, most high income people invest in real estate as it's a secure source of income. Because so many people invest in real estate, apartment towers are sold almost instantly, which makes prices go even higher. And that's also why i dislike real estate so much: it was really difficult for my parents to buy a house, and it won't be fully paid even when they're both dead.

8302,"I hate how the most profitable stocks to hold are also the most annoying ones. 

Like phoenix sky harbor airport should track the price of oil since they mainly just hold undeveloped oil field real estate as far as I can tell, but since swing trading oil these days is risky and only informed traders would find this stock the shareholders aren't taking the risk of swing trading and there isn't any eyeball traffic of people checking out the stock to assess its price or consider buying it so instead of tracking the price of oil, you just flip a coin to predict daily price movements based on whether a big buy will randomly happen that day or a big sell will randomly happen that day or neither. The long-term shareholders must wait like half a fucking year before actually seeing price changes as price changes and reacting to them, because the price chart doesn't look anything fucking like the oil price chart unless you shift one about 6 months closer to the other. It's so fucking annoying to hold as an active trader and passive traders aren't gonna find it.

All this adds up to nobody wanting it, which gives it guaranteed gains because there's not much of a bubble to worry about popping and the swindling supply of oil isn't even priced in, let alone inflated meme demand on top of it. But it's almost like being a wage cuck, in order to get paid I have to actually endure suffering and stress knowing that every day I check this ticker all it's going to do is either scare me, give me hope, or neither, just to fuck with my head while having so close to zero chance of any useful actionable information. 

I'm jealous of people who got lucky on the buying side with this one, for them it's probably not so annoying to hold the stock and way closer to being free money than wage cucking. But if they're strategic enough to hold stocks like this then they too have had times they weren't lucky on the buying side and it was annoying as fuck for them to hold something long term so I guess it's nothing to be envious of, just the random differences in dice rolls that always average out to the same levels eventually, all else being equal.",1

I didn't realize you had a time machine and accidentally slept inside of it, waking up 4-6 years after whatever timeline you're from.

""They no longer have the initial tax breaks to show a profit next year.""

Not relevant. They invest almost all of their net income in capital expenditures; land, factory construction, securing materiel contracts, equipment, acquiring other companies, research and development, etc. Re-inventing the wheel is, unsurprisingly, expensive. 

But, again, they *are* profitable. They've been profitable for a year. That is a minimum requirement to get into the S&amp;P 500, which they are. 

""&lt;demand whinging&gt;""

Okay.

""How the hell do you think a robo taxi is going to make it?""

Because they have the best engineers in machine learning optimizing the training of an algorithm that has access to millions of vehicles and the single largest dataset of real world computer vision driving data in existence, by far.

1) The chilean index is at subprime-crisis levels. This is ridiculous when comparing it to almost every other country in the world. I read the news everyday and analysts keep saying it's gonna go up, that it's lagging behind way too much when compared to the world, etc. Also high copper prices and commodity prices in general. Analysts mention the current price has lost its correlation with technical AND fundamental analysis and that it should recover. Actually I read a column from an analyst that talked about your point of ""economic activity"", and what this analyst said was that in order to go back to 2011 levels (55 USD, +48% from where it's at right now!), the economic activity should be as good as it was back then, but it's way, way better so it should just be a ""matter of time"" as global investors realize that Chile is doing good again and invest here. This hasn't happened as of yet... 

2) The typical story of the world's unluckiest investor in the SP500, the ""buy the dip"" narrative, and the typical recommendation of investing books regarding the ""time in the markets beats timing the markets"" perspective.

It seems both of these are just an illusion so you may be right.",0

Likewise, if you own shares and sell a covered call, your only risk is losing the shares above the strike, but if you are ok with that level of profit, it's a pretty attractive risk.

A lot of people sell options to act as a dividend. It takes effort to time it well, but the way most people sell options, it decreases the downside risk of the underlying shares.",0

9060,"Yeah i don't really want to invest in specific stocks because of this. Losing 70% of my portfolio wouldn't even surprise me after all that's happened. I can see your point there, being -17% in the red is not really that bad, but it's been 5 years of not being able to use that money, 5 years of disciplined saving in an indexed fund which is supposed to be safer and it's been nothing but losing money in my personal experience.

So i think i'm doing something wrong. I'm bullish on Chile: fast vaccination, the index is not in a bubble, actually over 1.5 standard deviations lower than other countries according to analysts. So it should keep recovering right? But these terrible events keep happening, one after another. So i dont really know what i should do.

So i take this fintech fund that invests in USA tech mainly and the next day i'm in the red already. And the next month is worse and now it keeps getting worse and worse. It honestly looks as if I single-handedly caused the tech-sector crash because of me investing in it. 

So yeah, i'll just keep waiting for years and years while my portfolio keeps crashing and crashing. Maybe in 20 years i'll be at 0% again? But i keep seeing these success stories of profits in the market... but for me even a 1% profit in 5 years would look AMAZING compared to where i'm at right now.",0

9065,"Also, yep, sometimes bad luck happens. Investing recently in high tech is stocks and high growth etf did take a hit. Sometimes it’s just the way it is. Unfortunately that’s when people want to buy stocks where they are high, because the thinking is, it might go higher. It’s much harder to buy stocks when they are going down, because then the thinking is, what if they keep going down. But generally you would want to wait for a correction or even a market failure to buy stocks that you believe will recover and grow, so that you buy cheap. This is basically value investing. But there are many more knowledgeable resources online than me. So I suggest looking at what other hedge fund managers are doing as get ideas from them. And sometimes the trend in general isn’t good. If us markets are going to go down, every fund or most of them will also go down.  Some might just go down less than others. Now, if you believe the market is turbulent and dangerous now, I would keep some cash just sitting around and waiting, so that when a correction happens you can get cheaper stocks. For example recently bill gates sold 11 stocks and bough 1. In some high tech companies he sold 100% of the stock or 50% of the stock. That’s probably a hint.

9097,"I work with sequencing data in general. Algorithm development and the sort. PACB long sequencing read technology is extremely useful for analyzing complex genomic events.

For many years these kinds of mutations could only be detected using ""sanger sequencing"" this is a very old and very expensive technology. PACB has made huge strides in lowering the cost of this kind of genomic sequencing. 
I also use it for genome assembly, this is when the genetic material of an organism is sequenced and it's genome is reconstructed from the sequencing data.  Many organisms have the annoying property of having ""repetitive"" sequenced in their genome. PACB technology helps dealing with this kinds of issues.
This is why I am very bullish in companies line PACB and 10x genomics their technology has been maturing for several years and it is slowly starting to show clinical relevance at scale.

9152,"Hey that's a good point! I'll edit the main post with some context on Chile. Sorry for making you read through this wall of text, i'll try to be as concise as possible!

I started investing IPSA in late 2017. Back then (early 2017), the index was looking good because of high expectations in the new president (Sebastian Piñera, a right-winging conservative) economic outlook, people thought Chile would skyrocket thanks to his administration.

2018 came and chilean growth was mediocre at best. People started noticing Piñera's better times (Tiempos Mejores) weren't a reality, as economy-oriented government reforms were hard to implement because of the left-wing politicans in the chamber of deputies blocking them.

It's 2019, the year of the commercial war between the US and China. China was the main economic partner of Chile, so the confrontation was very bad for the chilean economy. Some side effects of the trade war, according to analysts, include lower prices in commodities such as copper. There is a very high, known historical correlation between copper and the Chile IPSA index (you can read about it in [this](https://repositoriodigital.bcentral.cl/xmlui/bitstream/handle/20.500.12580/3612/BCCh-rec-v17n3dic2014p056-085.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y) paper, the point being it's been studied). So, low copper prices + trade war = $ECH goes down even more.

October 2019 comes and the 30 peso revolution starts. Public protests were an alien thing for us chileans before October 2019, we had a very stable country with low to none social revolts in our recent history. This revolt started because of a subway (Metro) fare price hike 2 days prior. Protesters destroyed the subway, supermarkets, police stations, and so on and so forth, asking for a refundation and a new constitution that replaces the one written by Pinochet's regime 40 years ago. The IPSA crashes.

Late 2019 comes and politicians from all sectors, left and right, conservatives and liberals, reach an agreement for a new constitution, one to be written by 155 electors chosen by popular vote in the same way as deputies. The IPSA goes up 8% in a single day because everything seems to be going good. The protests mostly stop and Chile finds its new peace. Investors are scared at first because of the potential dangers of a new constituion, but since we have a D'Hondt voting system, right-wing politicans are certain to reach the necessary threshold of representatives to keep the political stability that characterizes Chile as a country, especially when compared to its latin american neighbors. Investors stop fearing so much, and it's this point when i said to myself ""it's finally going to pay off. 2020 is going to be a great year for my portfolio!""

Then 2020 comes and the virus comes. The IPSA crashes to 2008 levels. At this point, it just makes me laugh how unlucky I can be. There is a small-percentage recovery right now from the absolutely low nonsense prices we had in 2020, especially because Chile is the second best country in vaccination speed after Israel, we're expected to reach herd immunity in June 2021 or earlier. Also copper is at all-time high prices, but we lost the copper-to-IPSA correlation after these recent events. 

That's where Chile stands at, 2009 levels right now. In order to recover my losses, the IPSA would need to recover from: a commercial war, a social revolt, the dangers of a new constitution, the coronavirus, and the impact of low copper prices from years prior.

OP, don’t listen to the haters.  Yes, I’d say you need to make some adjustments, but I think your head’s screwed on mostly right.
Force yourself to either get out of such volatile stocks (maybe consider ETFs, or less volatile, dividend paying stocks?), or force yourself to only check the shares at certain periods throughout the day/week/whatever.
Most stocks will rise and fall.  That movement shouldn’t mean anything to you.  Provided you’re in it for the long haul, you buy good companies that will grow and whose shares will increase in value.  It doesn’t matter if it’s up/down tomorrow unless you’re planning to sell them.
If, on the other hand, you are day trading and flip-flopping, then I have to agree with others on here and would suggest that this is too close to a gambling addiction.
If you want to have a little more control over your future net worth, take some time to create a budget and plan your spending so that you can add some savings to your portfolio every couple weeks.  Long term, that will help significantly.
All that said, remember that there are some very old men in this world who would trade their life’s fortune to be in your position right now.

Actually i read a while ago that $ECH is more than 1,5 standard deviations lower than the world average index price. 

I'm not expecting short-term gains, but in the last 5 years i've been diligently saving my entire income, so my current -17% profits aren't what I would expect after 5 years of waiting. I don't know if my expectations are set too high, but i would've expected -1%, 0% maybe after so much time?

I will wait 10 years and even more, I honestly think the approach you mention is good, way better than being scared every day, especially since stocks tend to go up in the long run. But in my experience, I don't think that's going to make a difference. Look at $ECH for example, it was 56 USD back in 2010 10 years ago, and in 10 year it hasn't done anything but lose much of its value.

My thoughts regarding this then tell me that maybe it's a bad idea to invest in $ECH since the past tells us this 10 years of waiting produces a NEGATIVE profit, so maybe i'll just invest in an option that works better historically in the long run: US tech stocks! That's what I told to myself and 3 days later the fund crashes, hard.

I understand your point, but i did consider most of it already so i'm still lost regarding the steps i should follow. I never get scared, but after 5 years i'm at an awful -17% gains even considering I NEVER sell. What should i do then? Keep waiting and lose more?

thanks imma get it soon",0
9339,RemindMe! 1 week,0
9340,"Well, if hedgefunders are winning millions on shorts but producing nothing, *someone* else is getting shafted.",0
9341,What do you mean by air-gapped? Disconnected from reality?,0
9342,How do you know an all time high isn’t a 52 week low.  Is this food advice all the time?,0
9343,"Hang in there. I know it’s rough seeing your investments go down for so long, but I want to congratulate you on sticking to it for this long, you definitely got the right idea.

I took a look at IPSA, and although the IPSA haven’t done much in the past 10 years, but it’s up 8 times in the past 26 years, you would actually have done pretty well with a 30 year time horizon. Now I have no idea what is going on with the ECH. It seems to do a really bad job of actually tracking the index. Do you have any idea of why this is?

I don’t know anything about the economics of Chile, so you probably knows better then me if you should be bullish on the Chilean economy.

In any case I think you are doing the right thing by trying to diversify outside of Chile, to the best of your ability. If you can try and find a fund that tracks indexes from other countries, and be aware of fees or hidden costs. The fund (or fintech) could easily be ripping you off.

If you can’t diversify internally you might want to look into bond or other fixed income vehicles. I generally don’t recommend fixed income in the environment, but if you are limited to Chile and don’t think the economy is going anywhere, or they can’t attract international investors, fixed income might be your best option. You can also consider if investing in real estate is an option. You can also do a split between bonds and stocks.",0
9344,You speak English better than most Americans that would judge you for being foreign. Keep rocking,0
9345,I don’t wanna sell anything for a loss and anything I have profits on i want to hold.  I’m young enough to hold through a recession. Good luck to us all.,0
9346,Thanks for the support. I don't think these types of folks who are governed by emotion appreciate my abrasive sense of humor very much.,0
9347,This guy fucks,0
9348,"With valuations at highs last seen in the dotcom bubble, how is the going to be a good opportunity to buy?",0
9349,"For every seller there is a buyer. 

All depends on the narrative. 
Instead of goldman sold billions in stocks, some mystery trader bought billions in stocks on Friday.",0
9350,You buy a Tesla (especially) bc you *want a Tesla* - I could see returning a used car bought sight unseen via an online used dealership service but I can’t imagine returning a new car let a alone a Tesla. Not as if there is a better option for that class...  but what do I know,0
9351,Amen; I keep accumulating. IMHO thid could double in 18 months.,0
9353,"Ive been trying since the end of feb to get out of my tech heavy portfolio. Imma hold my BB and SPCE because they are solid long term plays. I generally follow Buffet's strategy. Once I exist ALL my positions less BB and SPCE, Ill remain in cash until the market sheds a massive amount of value and then re-buy. Im 100% sold that disaster will strike the market within the next 6 months. I still think there are a month or two left of frenzy where money can be made.",0
9354,It's a joke. There is literally no point in a savings account anymore,0
9355,"Sort of like how all other currency in the world works?

If everyone decides USD is what they want to use, value will go up.

If everyone decides the Dollar is weak it goes down.

Obviously this is also effected by the reserves ability to print money, however that's an attempt to preserve the value... which will ultimately have long term repercussions.",0
9356,"There’s a lot of wild assertions in this that are very subject to market conditions.

The wheel is far from a perfect strategy. It’s a great strategy with stocks that stay mostly in range, but there are a lot of ways to lose money with it. You’re making the assumption that given enough time, the stock will always recover to its entry point price.

I’m not knocking the wheel btw, it works very well with mostly stable stocks - I’ve done very well wheeling JPM for a long long time. I just don’t like statements like “never not make money” and “little risk”. 

They’re not at all applicable to the wheel. Though, yes with careful stock selection you are minimizing risk but in a lot of ways you can end up more exposed if something goes wrong mid wheel turn when you’re holding actual shares.",0
9357,"Thanks for ur reply.You reply, just like most i received on last 24 hrs reflects great ( and well justified ) skepticism. This is music to my ears and from a contrary sentiment indicator standpoint reassures me we are either at or close to a major uptrend in the stock price.",0
9358,Some YouTube videos and start with SoFi,0
9359,"I think this might be a good idea, i won't withdraw my current money (i'd hate selling low) but i won't continue with my 100% saving plan. I have awful luck so i'll just save in the bank, 0% is still green to me.",0
9360,"If you don’t feel bad for creatures held in pens on ships, I’m not sure what to say to you",0
9362,"Sure!  I don't have option to post one in this response, but I'll post it in the community I started quick..",0
9363,"I'll take anything Cathie says with a grain of salt. At the end of the day, she is trying to maximize inflow and minimize outflow. How do you know what she says is genuine and what is damage control?",0
9364,Great info and trend forecast,0
9365,"Okay this is happening for me, too.

I had ETFM at .0080, sold at .0150 and bought again at .0083 and it has my cost basis all jacked up and says it’s a wash sale.",0
9367,"No idea, i'm not into cars and i had no cash when tesla was severely down. :(",0
9368,"Not quite - though, you’re still overall correct.

He’s doing a straddle, meaning he’s playing the “stonks always go up or down” game. If he’s getting a true straddle, he’ll make money either way and lose money if the stock trades sideways.

That said, you’re still right. A stock trading sideways would fuck him/her and it’s twice the loss than just playing it in one direction. It is a good move, though. Plenty of people do exactly this on volatile stocks in volatile markets and tend to make out - but 5% profit isn’t that much of one sideways trading period would result in 50-100% loss as might be the case with long straddles ( totally depends on how OTM he’s buying and if it’s weighted to one side or not).",0
9369,"&gt; doesnt sound good

But you cannot explain how it would be possible to do that on an exchange with order books. Can you? Especially not in the presence of buyer actually wanting to buy the shares at the offered price. 

I will go with supply and demand instead of your tinfoil hat theory. The price tanked because there were not enough buyers willing to pay the price on offer, so price adjusted itself downwards.",0

Let the quarterly earnings come through and the tech sector will prove it's worth....these are good blue chip stocks.

As for the other sectors like growth and speculative plays such as in the ark k fund they will have to improve their quarterly  earnings and EPS to show they can be profitable it will take a more than one year.....I recommend you watch some of the recent videos  of cathie wood where she talks abt growth stocks...and wht to expect....from her funds.

So I say for the above hold and hold dont sell....concentrate on 2 things
Average down if you have spare cash.......and increase your cash holdings too SAVE sit on cash.....remember  cash is an asset too.

It's like once all the fucking selling dried up from hedge fund liquidation a great weight was removed from the markets. Shorts were routed once again. We're spitting distance away from ATH on SPY.

Hard to predict, this is not financial advice. But the tech stocks you seems to invest in. Are very extended. They will likely perform well in the future. But in the short term they might not. Investing is also about long term horizon. If you’re truly investing you don’t want to watch your stocks everyday. That’s bound to put you in an emotional Rollercoaster. I personally completely missed last march’s correction and a few months later didn’t even notice. But if I was watching my long term investments in March I probably would have had a heart attack chicken out and sold low. Now I don’t know what’s going to happen in the future, and these are turbulent times. Personally I would find some educational material about value investing and look at bill gates, warren buffet, and those similar for how invest in choppy times. Then when things have bottomed out, and the feeling is in the market optimistic, get into ark and high growth stocks. But even so, understand that a fund can do well, but individual investors can still lose money. Why? Because they get scared when it’s not going up all the time, but high and sell low. If you truly don’t know how to invest just let the funds do the work and come back in 10 years. This is just my general ideas, I’m not a financial advisor.",0

9552,"“Only put money into the stock market that you can afford to lose”

This is misleading/inaccurate advice. 

I might tell someone this if they were buying a speculative risky stock at $200, knowing there’s a scenario in which it could go to $20 or less. Most people could not stomach that kind of loss. That’s also not really investing, it’s more like gambling. I would also give the same advice concerning options. Single stock investments can go to zero, they can decline by a large percentage and never recover. It is known. 

But if you never invest anything in the stock market because you’re afraid to “lose” it, I’ve got news. Cash is a guaranteed 1-2% loss every year you hold it. You need to take some risk with your money to achieve any kind of return. If you don’t, you will be grinding it out for a lot longer than you have to and possibly be left with not enough money to ever retire or leave to your kids. Sitting out is losing out. 

The key is taking the right risk. No, you shouldn’t invest any money you need for the bills or the mortgage, and you should have an emergency fund of at least 3 months expenses. If youre planning a big expense in the next year or two, definitely don’t put everything into the market. But beyond that, I would never consider money put in broad market index funds as money I could potentially never get back. 

Even if you had the worst timing you could have ever had in the last 20 years, and invested once in VFIAX at the absolute worst moment in 2007 before the financial crisis, you’d still have your money back within the decade (6 years later according to the chart, but actually sooner because of dividends). Meanwhile, if you had stayed invested, your money is now worth almost 3x as much.  

If you put that money under the mattress instead, your money is now worth 27% less. No joke. You lost nearly a third of your money doing jack shit. 

So let’s not go into this with the attitude “don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose.” The right attitude is, don’t gamble your money away, instead, make smart, diversified investments.",0

Meme stocks in particular are falling from grace and it's also possible with the economy reopening that people are losing interests in playing the stock market.

I don't know if this recent liquidation is just due to a poorly managed fund having a fire sale creating a great buying opportunities, or the leverage artificially inflated stock prices previously and the prices are now coming down to fairer value.  Definitely worth keeping an eye on it.

Yea, it’s a meme, but in reality the market returns 7-9% per year on average depending a bit of where you invest.

Nasdaq 10-14% if you look back 10 or 15 years. Dow 7-10%. So stocks go up. Not all, but most, and most of the time. 

And quality is expensive. Very few are successful bargain bin hunting, there are plenty of value traps out there and no, 4% dividend is not a good return. It’s 1/3 to 1/2 of what the market, on average, returns.

9691,"So... they shouldn’t present their case for predicted future value based on their understanding of future market conditions? I really don’t see how their forecast for Tesla is a conflict of interest. Transparency and forecasting are part of Ark’s thing.

Basically their entire prospectus is oriented around this idea that these technologies will hit an inflection point as they approach mass adoption and their stock values will grow rapidly. When they show their work on this for Tesla, everyone freaks out and says “Hey wait a minute, that’s too much! You can’t do that! They’re just pumping!” Those arguments just don’t hold much water with me. What would be the point in pumping something with a five year forecast? The timeline is too long for the pump to matter, even if the price rises short term it will drop to what people are comfortable with inside of that timeframe. Would damage the funds reputation for no real gain. I think it’s just cynicism run amok. Their TSLA evaluation is just an example of the kind of growth that Ark has always claimed is at the center of their investment strategy. But everyone gets all offended when they predict exactly what they always said they were trying to target. Maybe they’ll be right on Tesla, or maybe they’ll be right on one of their other holdings, that’s why you buy the fund instead of just TSLA. If a few take off the fund as a whole benefits. If Ark is wrong, the risk is distributed amongst their other holdings. 

If you compare five year growth for any major companies that have been successful with new technology, Ark’s evaluation for Tesla looks aggressive but not really obscene. This of course assumes Ark is right about TSLA being much more than just as auto manufacturer. A lot can change in five years.",0

I still only ever own 1 Bitcoin and have only held the asset for some period of time.  I haven’t actually lost anything except what I could sell it for as soon as I get it back.  If I also held that same Bitcoin for another 15 day period and sold on day 30 it could rebound back to $60k and there’s nothing changed.

The same is true in the inverse.  Buy a Tesla for 1 Bitcoin valued at $60k/per on day 1, get refund of $60k on day 15, on day 30 use the same $60k to buy back the same Bitcoin.

9829,"Exactly. New traders which seems the majority here now (just look at the profile when they joined) were told many times:

- Valuations will matter again but they don't care
- don't chase stocks but they don't care
- don't just jump on the reddit hype train and due some basic research but they just don't care

I said it before and I say it again most of the new people here have absolutely no clue how to valuate stocks and just want that other people tell them what stocks to buy. They just live in their 1 year bubble and mostly only experienced one of the greatest bull market in history.

They run up PLTR to $40 that would give it a forward P/S of 40 which is insanely high and can only be justified in a market where valuation doesn't matter. Even now at this price a forward P/S of +20 is very high considering their estimated revenue for 2021/2022

Same with BB and so many other stocks that are hyped here to no end.

Don't get me wrong when the first push for PLTR happened it actually had a decent valuation but that was around $12.50

Another problem is that many new traders don't even understand the most simple stock terms. They still don't even understand marketcap and just think a $1 is cheap and a $100 is expensive while it actually can be the exact opposite.

My feeling is that a lot of newbies will just disappear as long as they just buy random stocks that reddit ort youtube etc tells them to buy and are mainly just hype stocks",0

Second, the book value rarely captures information about intangibles such as brand value. While there is a spot on the balance sheet for intangibles, something like Apple's brand recognition is hard to place a dollar value on. Third, the PE ratio is a metric of a firm's market value of equity, (price/earnings per share is the same as market cap/earnings) therefore, the appropriate comparable is Book Value of Equity / Earnings, which can be negative.

- Don't panic, ignore FUD accounts.

- **Remove stop losses** (the big short attacks you see are hunting for them)

- Stop watching if you're nervous, set price alerts if you want

- Buy the dips if you can, but HOLD

- Trust the DD (providing some below)

- There are no hard dates for a squeeze, and you're only going to disappoint yourself otherwise

- This is going to be volatile. You do you, but in my opinion *Shares &gt; Options*

Banks are going to start seeing greater than -3% on the lends they gave out to these hedge funds and start margin calling them - causing squeezes like dominoes and then retail and long whales will liquidate to take in profits and we’ll se an even bigger sell off.

Once everyone willing to buy at $10 has purchased. That only leaves the people who would buy at $9, then $8, $7, $6. . . . . . .wait. . . . The stock price is going down . . . because we keep borrowing and selling shares to force it down . . . .

They have no motivation aside from getting rich quick. When the steam dies the whales will find a new money maker and it will fall to the $20 stock it should be.

What people believed has value, acquires value may work for collectables but does not hold up for stocks. Retail investors do not control stock prices, institutions do we are just along for the ride.

11303,"So SOXL is a 3x leveraged etf that has holdings specifically in semiconductors. Etfs aren’t stocks but a big soup of holdings in specific sectors, so SOXL holdings are primarily TSM AMD intel nvidia, big chip makers. Points are percentages +/-1%. When the “correction” downturn or whatever you wanna call it on the nasdaq started for various reasons recently Soxl’s main holdings lost value so its price went down as well. 

Now this is a buy the dip opportunity, SOXL being an etf typically has a ton of volume meaning if I write an option on it I’m very likely to be able to sell it quickly because there is a lot of buyers out there. I watched it bottom around 28 then slowly pushed past 32, between 32support and 35 resistance, but when it breaks 35 it runs to 38/39 very quickly. So for the past 3 weeks like clockwork it’s running up and down between 28-38. “LEAPS” are a term for long dated options usually expiring one to two years out. Leaps are a good defense against time decay and delta is typically over .6 so you’re getting almost 1$ per percentage it’s going up. Options contracts are in sets of 100 shares so you’re  getting 60-100$ in value per 1$ increase in price. When SOXL dips to 32 I buy a 40call leap and wait for it to push past 35 for that big gap up to 38 and I sell it for +300 to 500$. Being that it’s a leap if I’m wrong and it gaps down to 28 I’m still pretty safe because the time decay isn’t really an issue, so I just have to be patient.

11334,"&gt;	You don't know that you're wrong though

Yeah, just like you don’t know if you are right. The one sure thing you know, is that you don’t know for sure.
So you should always think of downside potential, not only upside.

&gt;	Is tesla, amazon, microsoft, apple, ibm not gonna go up in 5/10/20 years? Hell, one of them might go under, but probably not all of them.

“5/10/20 years” is not a timeframe. Pick one. You got a life to live, and there is a huge difference between 5 and 20 years if you have plans for the money invested.
If I make a bad investment, telling myself it will probably be ok when I’m 10 years older is of no consolation.

But again, the great problem is that we don’t know the future and don’t even fully understand the present.
An example, focused on the shorter end of your timeframe:
There is a theory that the rise of some of the most capitalized stocks was in part fueled by the increasing trend of passive investing. As lots of money got funneled in index funds, they had to buy more of the biggest companies, which led them to become ever bigger in a self reinforcing cicle.
What happens if index funds lose favor, for example to the advantage of thematic stock pickers like ARK?

When we look at 10~20 years, the risks are even greater IMO.
Remember, Exxon was the biggest company in the world. Nokia and BlackBerry were industry leaders. Yahoo was the face of internet search, and MySpace the social network. Sega used to be a big player in home consoles. Sony Walkman had similar brand recognition as the iPod later and iPhone.

That’s why I feel that active stock picking with a very long time horizon is more dangerous, not less. We have no idea what will happen in 5 years, much less in 20!
There is zero guarantee that Apple and MS and anyone else will still be relevant after so long. Google replaced Yahoo. Bitcoin and Tesla didn’t exist until recently. Long time brand names and market leaders faded, new ones were born and took their place.

Think about it, in 20 years many of these products will be bought by people who aren’t even born yet! How can you know what they will like and choose?
Look at Facebook. The new generation doesn’t like it nearly as much as the previous, favoring the likes of Instagram instead. Stuff that you find amazing, it may be seen as old people’s crap to yet unborn eyes.

11340,"You are incorrect. When the stock loses value, because the value of a short position is debt, the debt is reduced. 

\*\*\*\*Short positions are debt\*\*\*\* As a short position becomes profitable you arent making money, youre reducing debt, until ultimately, in an ideal scenario it goes to 0, which would be the bankruptcy of the company. 

So yes, you can buy something else with the money, because it isnt money you spent, it was debt, and now there is no debt. This is also why the risk of a short position can be limitless, that debt has no ceiling. Its not as if you put up X dollars to short something, shorts arent a put option you bought. It is taken on as variable debt and the fees paid to continue borrowing are based on the size of the debt, so if the debt is zero then so are the fees.

This is why the cost to borrow is a percentage, not a set dollar amount. You cant charge someone 0.3% on 1 share. That literally means nothing, unless the share has value, in which case it would be 0.3% of that value. And again, if that value is 0, 0.3% of 0, is 0.",0

11408,"Tesla was over valued based on its current sales and has been corrected.

Will it fall to $300 highly unlikely.   Will it raise to $800 in a few weeks also highly unlikely.

Looking at reports it should be a little over $800 in 12 months or within.   

Tesla on the current thresholds will keep it balancing between $620 and $700 for bit as it seems to have found its home even with its high viotility.   

Even Kathy Wood thinks Tesla is a long hold looking at 4-5 years out as their sales growth catches up to their share cost.

As far as other companies catching up, that isn’t happening if you read the reports it will take them 3-5 years to catch up to where Tesla is now with EV and by then Tesla will be so far ahead it won’t be a race.

I own some shares in Tesla when it was in the after split price and some in the $800 range.   

The problem with Tesla for now is it found its spot, like it or not.   So if you are getting into Tesla go Tesla long.

They say come with battery that has range of over 700 km (437 miles). [News of the EQS](https://www.daimler.com/innovation/digitalisation/industry-4-0/battery-production-hedelfingen.html)  


Also looks like they have entered joint venture with Volvo about fuel cell production.  


So while Tesla might have robotaxi comming, it will be interesting to see if Daimler trucks will come with self-driving trucks. I would imagine there would be more money in that than taxi driving. [Daimler selfdriving truck](https://www.daimler.com/innovation/case/autonomous/automated-driving-daimler-trucks.html) But other companies is also researching this e.g. scania have gotten green light by swedish government to test self driving trucks on the free ways.  


So while many hails Tesla for self driving and that they soon will have robotaxi, I think other companies a not far behind in making selfdriving vihicles.

Which sees a huge role for hydrogen - and not even carbon neutral hydrogen which is only to come after 2040 or so - in heating, transport and power system. While hydrogen can do all of those things, most of them it doesn’t do very well, so you‘ll end up with a very inefficient energy system across all sectors if hydrogen will be the end rather than the means. That translates into an expensive power system with slower decarbonisation rates than you could achieve if you had independent universities and consultants develop comprehensive decarbonisation scenarios rigorously tested for sensitivites, like that‘s the case in the EU or US have (which doesn‘t mean the politicians will always follow the advice, but it‘s at least a start).

That's the opposite of what EV needs.  I have no doubt that VW EV owners will have to replace the battery around 5-7 years of ownership.

Typical car companies save the newest features for the best model.   TSLA is not doing this (the Model Y has newer/better features than the model X).  I agree with this approach.

I've not met an actual TSLA owner that is pissed off because of the delay in FSD.  Infact, I've know more people w/o FSD than with.  That's great for TSLA.  By the time FSD gains traction, there will be a ton of vehicles w/o FSD hitting the used market.  All TSLA needs to do is adding FSD to those vehicles and turn them around for a 5-10k extra profit.

The current US electrical grid is not suitable for large scale EV adoption.  To level out the demand, whole house battery/solar system is needed, TSLA definitely has a horse in this race.

China is a very important market and TSLA is the AAPL of the Chinese EV market.  Sure there are tons of local brands phone with more features at a lesser price,  the iPhone will has great profit from the Chinese market.  Tesla will be the same - a #1 choice among the richer part of the population.  EU EVs will also share this richer population but w/o the benefit of a local factory.

Other smaller EV companies are just noise.  Things only get serious when AAPL and Toyota enter the market.

TSLA is also a b-i-t-c-o-i-n holding company.  While many people may thing it's a negative,  I think it's a good thing for the company.  it's not much different from McDonald is as much as real estate company as a fast food company.  It sets the low for the company values.


Most people would agree that last month TSLA has seen very significant drop.  Look at the data,  it's more than $10/week.  However I also lower my cost basis by $8-$10/week selling CC while waiting for the chip shortage to lift and the cyber truck to roll out.  Now if TSLA drops down to the $500 then I won't be able to sell CC at my original purchase price and may have to hold.  I'll worry about that when the time comes.

If you can't effort to get 100 shares of TSLA, it's not a stock for you.  The ability to get high premium consistently is the key during the chip shortage period - ""get paid while you wait"" should the slogan for owning TSLA stock.

When TSLA hit 380 during the battery day week,  some people wanted to wait for 350 to get in.  They've been waiting ever since.  To be fair,  I bought a bunch of shares at 380 just to have them called away quickly after at 450.  The shares that I held got sold at the limit order of $695 not too long after that.",0

11577,"Exactly you don’t understand what’s going on but the way you right your post you’re misleading people as of you do. That article you posted read it again. The source is one random person nothing but speculation. Your logic is flawed because of this: if stocks start to sell off then the short sellers would start to make money. Why on earth would they have to cover their positions? You’re engaging in backwards reasoning. You desperately want your AMC and GME to do well so every single time a market event happens you tie it to the short sellers in a desperate attempt to trick people into either buy more shares of these stocks or those that have to not sell. I know exactly what you’re doing and it’s called market manipulation and fraud and I am fucking GOD DAMN TIRED OF IT ALL.

SLR only existed because of Covid and before the banks were just fine without it. The banks don’t want it to go because it was a benefit for them and that’s how banks are. They will desperately fight for any little benefit for them to increase their margins. But it will be gone and they will adjust and things will be fine. You are creating hysteria for no reason other than your own personal gain. Why are stocks so volatile this month? Because the S&amp;P500 is up over 57% from Covid lows the Nasdaq is up 70% yes you read that right the Nasdaq is up 70% in one year. And people are acting like that’s not enough. I FUCKING NEED MORE!!!!!! Contrary to what a lot of the noobs here thinks stocks don’t always go up and periods of corrections and decline are necessary so that the actual economy can catch up to the stock market or the else we get a bubble and a subsequent crash of 40%. 

Everything you said is completely false. You are misinterpreting a bank/treasuries/fed event as something that will trigger a short squeeze, of course you did because everything will lead to a short squeeze to you people.

Car manufactureres usually have a P/E of ~10.

11676,"AMC wasn't cheaper to get into. 

You just psycologically saw a smaller price and felt it would be a better investment.

Your 5 dollar AMC shares gets you 22 shares for 110 dollars 

Your 110 dollar GME share gets you 1 share for 110 dollars

So far AMC has squeezed a max of 4x and gme has squeezed a max 40x
If GME squeezes proportionally higher than AMC as it has been:
That 400% squeeze would be more like 4000% 

So if amc squeezes 400%, those 22 shares at 110 are worth $440 dollars.
If GME squeezes 4000% proportionally again then that one share at 110 is worth $4,400.

While I think this is a good case, I'm not entirely convince. If I remember correctly, prices started to rise in 2005 and it took a full 3 years for producer stocks to moon. I've also read that there was a good deal of manipulation of steel prices back in '08, so you have to wonder how much of the bump in prices was due to that.

His case also relies on demand from China, but I actually don't think that will hold. In absence of a boycott of Chinese steel, falling demand for steel from China will lead to more dumping, which will suppress steel prices and be extremely bad for non-Chinese producers.

11816,"&gt; So, let me first say that I am bullish steel and other industrial metals
&gt;Source: I'm an industrial metals trader

Well that definitely adds to the bullish case lol. I'll troll through your post history if its all in there, but I'd be interested in hearing your case for steel and any other industrial metals you're bullish on. I really think the big trades of 2021-2023ish are going to be in food, industrial commodities, and bonds.

I was actually looking for *any* bearish case for non-chinese steel producers to work out whether this is a good trade, but I think you made a really good specific case as it relates to the semi-conductor issues. I remember the Biden administration specifically talking about auto when addressing the semi-conductor crisis so there is a good chance we see a decline in demand for steel due to reduced production due to lack of semi-conductors. Likely, this won't be limited to the US alone, I can imagine that it will affect auto manufacturers internationally. Which begs the question: *if* there is a boycott of Chinese steel, will demand for non-Chinese steel hold?

From what I understand, the largest purchasers of Chinese steel are South Korea, Vietnam, Thailand, and the Philippines, who I would think would follow any US/EU boycott to signal their alignment in any potential conflict. I believe South Korea is pretty big on auto (Hyundai and Nissan maybe?), so their demand for steel could potentially tank if the semi shortage continues.

Section 232 is also a good point for American steel manufacturers, also keeping in mind that any infrastructure bill would likely have some sort of ""buy America"" provision. This would definitely be bullish for American steel, but the question is whether we have the capacity.

So I guess that leaves the questions of:

How much will the semi-conductor shortage lower the demand for steel due to auto manufacturing constraints?

Does the US have a large enough productive steel capacity to be the sole supplier of any large-scale infrastructure project?

Who will have the most demand for non-Chinese steel, and where will they buy it? It seems to me that most of the Chinese steel importers are regional (which makes sense due to shipping) so the likely benefactor would also be regional, if there are any. I can't find an article to support this at the moment, but I also seem to remember reading somewhere that India will be suspending steel exports until like June or July, which is also very interesting.",0

Shorting the stock of a company that goes bankrupt is like winning the lottery. The money you receive for shorting the stock is all yours, though there might be some delay in freeing it from the broker's grip -- it holds the money as collateral until it writes off the loan. You'll owe capital gains tax on your profit unless you shorted the stock within an individual retirement account.",0

11866,"Discovery is a diamond in the rough. It is a value play a growth play, and a short squeeze play. Goldman’s forced liquidation of the stock allows their buddies to cover. Short interest is 30% of the float. There was no natural way the stock would have retraced like this after running up 300%. Manipulated. 

Pre-streaming Discovery is doing $3B in free cash flow at a $18B market cap. Their EV.EBITDA is like 8x. Their executive management is savvy and executing on their strategic plan financially and product-wise. They have the largest content portfolio and it is well diversified across demos and internationally:

Food network, animal planet, hgtv, tic, own, travel channel, discovery channel, science channel, history channel, motortrend, premier league soccer, golf tv, magnolia networks, are all Discovery. It’s a beast.

Add into that a streaming service that is actually extremely strong in terms of tech and execution and you have a growth story. It saw 11m subs in the first 50 days and is rated higher than all other services (4.9 in Apple App Store for example). It’s crushing and they have the EU distribution rights to the Olympics to push it harder. 

It makes more money in terms of cash flow than Netflix or Disney before streaming. Earnings could feasibly double this year with streaming. Netflix is valued at over $200B and Disney over $300B. After this drop Discovery is back under $20B. 

My gut tells me the righting was on the wall with this company. Viacom felt more like hype but I haven’t looked into it as much. Definitely not as financially strong as Discovery not is their content portfolio as massive. Discovery has something like 10x the content as Netflix and it’s much cheaper to produce and more diversified across demos. 

This coerced event gave shorts an opportunity to cover on a largely overlooked stock with a compelling story that could have arguably been valued 3x higher on a comparative basis BEFORE the 40% drop this week.

Couldn't really find any other sources that specifically talked about taxes when a company goes bankrupt while you're short. There is one other reddit comment from 6 years ago that mentioned the same thing with ""tax-free"", but it was hearsay from a colleague a long time ago.

Second, they are not oversold. Go look at their RSI, I took a peek at the Nasdaq and it's sitting at 50. It's not oversold or overbought.

It's all their assumption, but they ASSUME the banks will do these things, as they assume they will also slow their lending to ensure they meet equity requirements. 


Besides the fact that these analysts work for the same financial groups they report on (and we've seen over the last month, and in 2008, how THAT goes), their own article doesn't dispute OP's assertion - that the ""free"" ride Hedge Funds/MM's have been with increased leverage from the banks is about to end.

Now that people saw you have a chance some to make money off this piece of shit company the whole narrative on reddit instantly changed. People who have never even heard of a hedge fund are now heroically fighting them to help save the underdog.
How dare these evil hedgies try and take out the little guy! We stand with GS! I'll spend every penny I have to do what's right and help GS survive! 

It's such bullshit, if you want seize an opportunity to make some cash off a HFs overconfidence, cool, I'm fine with that. I'm just sick of everyone running around like they're some kind of hero helping save the little guys from the evil hedgies you didn't know were a thing until a month ago. 

Own what you're doing, you're hoping a company will go bankrupt so you can get paid. You want all those people to lose their jobs so you can get paid.

Or to put it more simply: 

r/Stocks - Wait for dip make your plays

r/Investing  - Ignore the noise and put money in the market in whatever vehicle or equity you choose, now.  

I think the issue is a lot of people get their wires crossed and use trading mindsets when making long term investments. If you find a good stock, it doesn't matter if it dips 5% next week if you are investing on the premise that in the next 10 years it will have grown 5x (or whatever, too lazy to do the math). 

If you want to take the mindset that you want to make the most from your money and want optimal returns though, chances are for most people that doesn't happen trading stocks anyway or timing any market. Waiting for a dip is an unsophisticated gamble that may never happen. Multiple times you will be wrong and this will cancel out all the times you are right.",0

For the inexperienced investors holding Tesla stock, it can be seen as a precious, unique ticket to riches and validation.
In a market full of uncertainties and risks, there is their certainty of success. They see it as irreplaceable because they can’t see any alternative.

For Musk, Tesla is largely Mission Accomplished. It kickstarted - or at least accelerated - the switch to EV. It helped bring a change on the world.

What’s left equally amazing for Tesla to do? Sell lots of cars? So unglamorous, not a goal worthy of a visionary.
Revolutionize self driving? Many extremely skilled companies are already working on it. It’s not an unique opportunity to make a difference. Green energy? Same story.

If Elon wants to aim again for the moon, he probably needs to move his attention progressively away from Tesla. And that’s what I expect him to do.
Rockets, AI, cyber interfaces, are some of the objects that have long been on his mind.

A funny idea, what happens if Musk founds a new company to work full time on some new high ambition, world changing goal? Where does that leave Tesla shareholders betting on future something-or-the-other, Tesla-is-an-everything-company? Hanging on to the dreams of yesterday?",0

The recession and the high values resulting from low profits are not quite correct. During dotcom bubble was not an economic crisis, the prices for the companies were just extremely high. In addition, the key interest rate also influences the level of the value, low interest rates lead to high values.

Of course, it is also questionable to what extent the composition of the S&amp;P500 has an influence on the value. More and more tech stocks (which on average have a high P/E) make up large parts of the entire index. Since this is a cross-sectional data panel, this effect is not taken into account here. The Schiller P/E can therefore very well say something, but only in combination with other findings and influences.",0

https://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a5609/chimpanzee-attack-0409/

As St. James confronted the chimp, the six-two former running back turned to find a second chimp — also a male, this one older and bigger — bearing down on him as well. With both hands, he pushed the bigger animal. Both chimps pounced. One of the animals grabbed him in a bear hug before chomping into the bone above his right eyebrow. He then stuck his finger in St. James's right eye, gouging it out. The same animal clamped his teeth onto St. James's nose, biting it off, as the other chimp chewed away at St. James's fingers. In the melee, one of the chimps dug in his claws and ripped the skin off the right side of St. James's face, causing it to flop over and cover his left eye, temporarily blinding him. One of the primates sunk his teeth into St. James's skull. He then closed his jaws on St. James's mouth, ripping off his lips and most of his teeth. St. James tried to put one of his hands down the animal's throat, but the chimp just kept chewing on it and chewing on it, and he couldn't get it out.
St. James fell to the ground, no longer able to defend himself, and for at least five minutes, the mauling continued as he lay helpless. One of the chimps gnawed on his buttocks and bit off his genitals. They ravaged his left foot, leaving it shredded. Blood poured from his body, and LaDonna was screaming. It looked as if they were eating him alive. Finally, LaDonna's screams drew the owners' son-in-law, Mark Carruthers, who came running armed with a .45-caliber revolver. After struggling to find a clean shot, he opened fire on the younger primate. The shot had no apparent effect, and Carruthers raced back to his house, a few dozen yards away, to reload with more-powerful ammunition. When Carruthers returned, he focused on the older male, the prime aggressor. Kneeling down, he shot him once in the head from close range. As the animal fell to the ground, the younger chimp began dragging St. James's mutilated body down a hill leading away from Moe's cage. Dirt filled St. James's lungs and seeped into his bloody openings.",1

On average, we see 35k cases of MM in the USA and 12k deaths. CAR-T is meant as one of the last lines for patients who do not respond to more standard primary lines of treatment.

If the deal gets approved (which is targeted to happen before the end of Q3 2021),  for every share of ALXN that you own, you will receive 2.1243 shares of AZN + $60 in cash (but you would no longer hold any ALXN at this point, as the company would be part of AZN and be delisted).  

As of today's prices, ALXN trades at a discount to ""deal parity"", meaning that you can buy ALXN and wait to be converted into AZN (again, assuming the deal is successful). That would be a better entry price than buying AZN today in the market.",1

Look what I did to this market with a few memes of gorillas rockets and cats. Hmmm? You know… You know what I’ve noticed? Nobody panics when things go according to plan. Even if the plan is horrifying! If, tomorrow, I tell the SEC, that a retail investor got fucked, or a truckload of holders will bleed, nobody panics, because it’s all “part of the plan.” But when I say that one little hedge fund will die, well, then everyone loses their minds! *(Ape hands Cramer a gun and points it at his forehead.)*Introduce a little anarchy.

There are falling knives that do continue falling for extended periods of time and there are too many options on other stocks have that kind of risk appetite 

Buy at the dip and take profit are top strategies. Example Think of those buying solid AAPL at 130. Look at it now. Do you want it long term? For what reason exactly? It only locks down capital for a ridiculous dividend.

Tesla is getting serious competition; the demand for EVs can now be met by other companies. Market share is shrinking in all markets and will shrink even more in the coming months.

FSD is a big lie. Elon has been promising it would be available next year since 2015. What is the problem now? Many people spent 10k on the potential for FSD. But now years have passed and people may have already bought a new car in the meantime. The 10k was totally wasted. And Tesla itself has admitted that FSD is only level 2 and this will not get better in the near future. 

Gruenheide is properly delayed. No cars will come off the assembly lines there in the summer. Completely impossible.

You can also see that Elon's ass is on the line. He tries to hide all this bad news with one smoke grenade after the other.

13122,"I agree. Presently, the environmental damage associated with driving an internal combustion engine car is still largely externalised, but this is changing. For one, CO2-levies on transport fuels are being introduced in many countries. Secondly, emissions standards are getting tighter. This is pricing in the environmental aspects of driving an internal combustion engine (ICEs) car and making it more expensive, and therefore increasingly a luxury. 

I don’t think any government anywhere will ever flat out ban the sale of gasoline and diesel fuel, as the political prive would have been too high. (even though bans on sales of new gasoline and diesel cars have already been imtriduced im some countries, starting in the 2030s.) Rather, the governments will price out the ICEs through a combination of increases capex and opex (see above), plus making electric cars more attractive. 

The end game for the policy makers I think will be to price out the fossil fuels and eliminate their emissions, and replace them with synthetic fuels for the wealthy if they so choose and with electric drives for the masses. So people wanting to enjoy their Porsches and Ferraris will always be able to to that, but not poeple driving Volkswagens, as that will become too expensive per kilometer driven. 

In a somewhat ironic policy twist, the expected EU emmissions standards require such expensive technologies that Renault has decided to discountinue the Twingo model, because small cars have margins that are too thin to accomodate that. That’s different for bigger, more expensive cars that are offen also gas guzzlers. So the trend of ICEs being priced out might have started at the wrong end, but it’s started nevertheless.",0

Why do image sensors matter so much, well, image sensors are key for cameras, medical imaging equipment, security and surveillance, ai and robotics, barcode readers, phones (your phone will have Sony parts unless it's a Samsung) and most lucrative of them all, autonomous vehicles.This currently brings in 26% of Sony's revenue, at a 13.5% margin.                                
 
Next is Sony music, the biggest music publisher in the world. They have some of the biggest names in the industry, with artists like Ed Sheeran, 21 savage, childish gambino, DJ Khalid and more. And as music streaming grows (with Spotify reporting 29% year over year growth, and tencent music  70%), Sony will be in a great position to dish out music from its signed artists. Music makes up 16% of Sony's revenue at a margin of 20%.( I will talk more about ""other "" at the end of the DD, but just so you know, other is grouped into music).                                  

Next is playstation.

And that number of ps plus subscribers is only set to grow, with gaming being the fastest growing aspect of entertainment. It is also likely that we will give our children PlayStation's, who will in turn give their kids kids PlayStation, like how whole families come together to watch the Simpsons.

You may know of the ongoing streaming war, and one of my favourite quotes is don't make wars, provide ammo, which is exactly what Sony is doing. You may not know but Netflix don't actually produce their exclusives, they out source it, and one of the studios they outsource it to is Sony, Sony has made quite a hit for Netflix, The crown, with a reported 73 million households watching it. But Sony pictures doesn't just do work for Netflix, they also have done Alex Rider, a prime exclusive and Greyhound, an apple TV exclusive. Sony pictures brought in 8% of revenue at a 9.6% margin.           

Next is Sony electronics, who make things from headphones, televisions and their world renowned camera's, there are countless videos on YouTube, of people positively speaking of their switch of Nixon to Sony, showing a high brand loyalty in the photography market. 10% of revenue at a 6.6% margin. 

Next is financial services, I can't comment too much on them, as I didn't research them thoroughly, but I can say that their revenue is  10% at a 10.6% margin. 

Now I will discuss other. So first up is Sony's quiet move into monopolising anime, the second fastest growing aspect of entertainment, they have acquired crunchy roll, funimaton, aniplex and more. This means that if will be very hard for other streaming services to compete with Sony's anime, like how it was hard to compete with Netflix. A another quote from my favourite business book is be best or be first, and Sony are doing both in the anime market.                                                                               
 
Next is Sony's car, I feel it's a marketing stunt to show off and advertise their parts to other automakers, but it really shows what Sony is capable of, with Sony audio in the car, sony image sensors, Sony infotainment and more. 

Lastly is their mobile game, I again can't comment too much on it but it is very popular in Asia and brings in 1 billon in revenue, any questions feel free to ask. It's a kind of simple DD but I can elaborate on certain sectors you are interested in",0

Next is Sony music, the biggest music publisher in the world. They have some of the biggest names in the industry, with artists like Ed Sheeran, 21 savage, childish gambino, DJ Khalid and more. And as music streaming grows (with Spotify reporting 29% year over year growth, and tencent music  70%), Sony will be in a great position to dish out music from its signed artists.

Next is playstation. Sony has managed to do something quite brilliant with playstation, they have managed a transition from physical games to digital games, why does that matter, well, digital games gives sony higher margins. But the most exciting aspect of playstation is ps plus, ps plus has went from only 4m subscribers back 6-7 years ago, to having 48m subscribers, more than HBO max, and actually, ps plus now has a bigger operating profit than Netflix, whilst Netflix had 2x the market cap of the entire Sony business. And that number of ps plus subscribers is only set to grow, with gaming being the fastest growing aspect of entertainment. It is also likely that we will give our children PlayStation's, who will in turn give their kids kids PlayStation, like how whole families come together to watch the Simpsons. You may be thinking of their competitor, Xbox, but Xbox has only really solidified in North America and western Europe, with Sony significantly beating them Asian market.

When prices fall 30% or more, you can be sure there's a lot of over-reacting in the game.

&gt;Point is, covid crash taught us you can’t time it, buying at those  prices seems no brainer today. But also seeing your gains gone and  dumping more  money into market a month into pandemic seems like suicide  then.

It may feel bad to invest more but that is just a mental block. You have to get over with it to benefit from low prices. A good mindset is to look forward to crashes.

By the time you can, with your limited view into the market, identify a power house from a scan, the stock's already over valued. You may still be able to make a bit of money from continued expansion, but it's not even going to be close to investing in an Amazon or a Tesla back in the day.

And even then, Chinese regulations can change quickly depending on government priorities, and as an international investor, the chances of you identifying those changes quickly enough to pump or dump before those on the inside do, is low.

13267," Fortescue Metals may have been on the rise throughout the past few years due to the increasing demand of iron ore from international markets like China, however they may be a point where China believes that they can import iron ore from other countries and regions, such as Brazil and certain African countries, despite reports taken into these deposits that they have lower overall iron ore quality, however China may be reluctant to import from Australia as relations slow down and may settle for lower quality in order to avoid any chances of Australian tariffs if any are placed as well as they might believe that they don’t need as much steel production for infrastructure, which would kill Fortescue’s biggest market off. FMG would have to look at alternative countries and demographics, which they have looked into South American countries to extract iron ore from and export iron ore as well.

In my opinion a lot of catalysts for the short squeeze have been lining up for a few weeks now. I won't speculate on when, because nobody knows.

13291,"I work in public policy in Germany where the debate on electric mobility vs. hydrogen mobility vs. synthetic fuels has been settled for a while now. the long story short is, electric mobility, due to simple physics, has the highest overall energy efficiency, from your solar panels or wind turbines to your wheel. hydrogen is distant second, synthetic fuels are dead last. in fact, you need 4 to 5 times more solar and wind power for the same number of kilometres driven for hydrogen than for direct electric drive. that translates into 4 to 5 times the capex for power production alone, plus capex for the extra conversion step from power to hydrogen (ever heard that electrolysers being expensive? well ...). for synthetic fuels you need *even more* clean power and *another extra* conversion step. no amount of subsidies will make synthetic fuels competitive with battery in our life times. all serious researchers and policy consultants have known this since before the battery prices dropped 90% in the last decade. there’s a reason Tesla is the most valuable carmaker in the world.

You know to whom synthetic fuels make sense? To the carmakers still sticking theit head in the sand and hoping the governments bail them out. although it’s probably not even an honest play and even they know the future is electric, but their c-suite wants to make it look like they’re on top of things and earn their golden parachutes. that’s why they need to make it look like the internal combustion engine has a future in a zero-catbon world. in Germany, you can see how busy the still-world leading carmakers are lobbying for the slowest transition and toothless regulations possible. with some success, too. but if the battery prices drop another 50% by 2025 and the upfront cost of an BEV is on paar with an ICE, it won’t matter. 

sure, synthetic fuels might be how air and sea traffic are decarbonised, and renewable hydrogen will be needed in industry. but for road transport, don’t buy the carmaker’s propaganda.",0

13309,"If you understand the market, that is the conglomerate of ""retail"" individuals and ""institutional"" investors is still the very same to the core, but now augmented by much more technology. 

Algorithm Trading, HF Trading and the like are way more accessible to the ""institutional"" part of the market - that's the perceived ""edge"" they have. I hope this will change soon as smart individuals are hopefully working on smart invest AIs across the globe for people to have access to these trading algos on an everyday basis if they choose to.

What always existed, to my very limited knowledge, is:

\- *Informed Professionals* who are closer to some information or closer ""to the market"", aka Traders sitting at Market Makers, Analysts with direct lines and more real time access who can execute a trade in seconds, not minutes. 

As an analogy to the very far past: think back to the roaring 1920s. Stock trading was a fad. However, ""Telegraphs"" delayed the ticker values by several minutes even outside the stock exchange where actual trading was executed. Today you sit at a Bloomberg terminal or your brokerage account and push a button almost in real time to buy at a certain price. The people sitting at trading desks have more direct access. This has changed vastly though as you can also get ""Level 2"" data nowadays as an individual investor. The gap is closing.

\- *Dark Pools* in one or the other way

\- *""Behind Closed Doors"" trading* (related to the above) by direct deal making. Think big instituational money lenders and the acquisition of direct Warrants, exchangable to shares under certain conditions.

\- *Whale Investors* who can influence and play the system as they know more than the individual investor (not sure that is still true in terms of knowledge, but certainly in access to analyisis with more data or professionalism) or they simply have more weight on share prices when they decide to move

The ""Short Game"" has been literally played since ages ago, you can read up all about it in literature. 

The long game, however has never changed and proven by Grantham and Buffet to be the most successful way to be ""in the game"". 

Now, how you place investments is for you to decide. 

The simple way is to ""set and forget"" your bets in solid companies that you believe will further your investment and grow their value by doing the right moves, investing in the right technology and people to grow their overall business and build technological moats around them to gain an edge lon term. 

So if your time horizon for investing is set to 15-30 years, the long game is what wins you money. 

If you're in the short, volatility, swing trading game, prepare to be rattled and stressed by your investing decisions, as this is a full-time job.

A few things to think over:

Price remains a concern.

Distribution also. It needs to be adopted by the whole industry or it won’t make it to your fuel station.

Green fuels won’t stop the move to EVs. Electric is just better to drive, easier to care, doesn’t smell and choke you when you are in a converted road or big city.

So eFuels, assuming they see adoption, may become an option to keep certain old cars usable for longer, specifically those with some historic value.

Let’s not forget we already have a kind-of environmental friendly and inexpensive alternative fuel: LPG.
I have a dual fuel LPG car. With it I can go in the city center on days of traffic closure because of pollution, and at a rough calculation it’s about as expensive to run as EV charged on a public fast chargers.
You can also convert many existing cars to use it. Yet you don’t see anyone care much about. In fact, it probably gets willfully ignored to make the case for EV look more compelling.",0

The premise that retail investors have placed institutions in a position where the stock market is tanking as a result of mass liquidation is greater evidence for brokers to have a vested interest in NOT margin calling institutional investors.

If a massive margin call would trigger the short squeeze, it would presumably cause the bankruptcy of many institutions, in which the brokers calling the margins would be shit out of luck (both in regards to the short, and in regards to a major collapse of the rest of the stock market).

13511,"Consider introducing him to the Boglehead approach and getting him started with a solid ETF/index mutual fund portfolio. In my opinion, when anyone is just learning about investing, they should start their portfolio with index funds. If they later want to start playing with stock picking, they can do it with a tiny percent of their portfolio.

But for someone young like your brother who is investing for the long-term, who shouldn't care about the day to day swings in the market, he should probably just start with ETFs. But then again, so should everyone, realistically.

This approach is particularly well suited for people who may not be super interested because they can ""set it and forget it,"" with automatic deposits and investments. If they do this, it could be in their favor as they may be less likely to sell in a market downturn.

This may be r/stocks, but ETFs are still a useful tool and may be a better fit for your brother.

If you go the ETF route, Fidelity, Vangaurd, and Schwab would be my three recommended brokers, in no particular order. They generally have the best offerings in terms of ETFs with low expense ratios. You'll find that the Boglehead forums has an obsession with Vanguard, being that it was founded by Jack Bogle. However, Fidelity is equally great, has great customer support, has more physical locations, offers other services like a 2% cash back credit card, and has  even brought the race to the zero expense ratio ETF to the bottom. I'm less familiar with Schwab, but I believe their benefits are similar to Fidelity and I know they have low expense ratio ETFs. Oh, and Fidelity and Schwab's websites aren't as bad as Vamguard's.

As for the issue of ""How easy Robinhood is,"" that's by design and isn't helping you. Robinhood's UI is designed to make people focus on day to day market changes and making lots of trades when realistically you need to look at much longer trends and be making fewer trades. None of the other brokerages' UI's are so terrible that they are going to be hindering your brother.

That article mentioned a likely effect was slowly  bank dividend payments, or slowly loan *growth*,  if it had any effect.

Really? Because what is this then? https://sportsgrindentertainment.com/tiger-cub-archegos-liquidation-triggers-record-crash-in-discovery-viacomcbs-sources/

Also, you mistook my words. I’m saying that if a firm has a large short position, and they have to suddenly get liquidity they will sell their longs obviously but they will also have to cover some of their short positions to buy those shares back. Shorting is risky, therefore they may be seen as a very serious risk and to cover their risks clearing houses may up the borrow fee. I never said anything about the fed. 

You act like the market is a well oiled machine when it is full of corruption that starts at the top. By removing SLR off the table it has given big firms and the like more free range to do as they please. I firmly believe that the amount of shorting taking place is on the verge of abuse of the system. Look at what happened to GameStop. It was shorted 128%. Tell me that’s not abuse.

FSD is a toy for geeks amusement. For everyone else it has little practical value, because it requires paying more attention to the road than when you are driving yourself, making driving more stressful, not less.
An useful driving assistance package is one that is enritely predictable, even if it works only in restricted situations. Smart cruise control so you don’t have to pay attention to speed limits, lace centering for long stretches of straight highway, low speed stop and go in tight traffic, blind spot monitoring and danger warnings, these are all useful, at condition they work in simple at predictable ways.
You don’t want them to use a logic so “advanced” that you can’t easily predict their actions.

Rising bond yields are not really the major concern, it’s the rate of change that has investors spooked. Also the dollar is rising, despite unlimited printing. Doesn’t seem rational.

Could GME be another reason? Maybe. It's possible.

If you go back far enough you can see corollaries to today.

I think the reason why you're confused is that you don't really understand your investments. Given what I read, it seems you haven't done enough analysis on different companies and your ""plays.""

The shadiness you see is just speculation. There have always been people trying to get one over on others. There have always been DeLUIsiOnAL people who try to convince others. And there always has been crowds pushing up bubbles.

The question isn't one between blue chips and potential future diamonds (whatever that means). The question is what a particular company is worth, whether the price you can pay is lower than what its worth, and the size of the cushion in the case something unexpected happens. As Warren Buffett says, the market is a voting machine in the short term and a weighing machine in the long term.

As far as specific stocks, I've always said one of the hardest things about stock trading is knowing what stocks are out there. I let the indexes sort out what stocks have legs from those that don't. The nasdaq 100 is the top tech index, those are your solid blue chips. 100 stocks isn't too difficult to keep track of. One obv drawback to following an index is yeah, you might miss a new ipo that 🚀 but once you are used to watching a list, reading the news about upcoming releases makes sorting through easier. 

Trading &amp; investing will always be there and will always be subject to advancing technology. Algos will probably be more available for individual investors in 10yrs and things that I can't imagine will be out there as well.

13781,"So, let me first say that I am bullish steel and other industrial metals.  
However, the post is asking for a bearish case for steel as it relates to the semiconductor shortage.  To that end, I'll play devil's advocate. the bearish case is that semiconductor supply to domestic automotive supply-chains are tightest.  In fact some U.S. auto assembly plants are being taken off line NOW as a result of the semiconductor chip shortage.  The auto industry is a large consumer of steel.  The chip shortage will artificially stunt U.S. auto production and an important component of domestic steel demand. This reduction in demand will result in a reduction in steel prices.

As for the geopolitical situation (tensions) with China impacting Chinese steel imports, the Section 232 tariffs enacted under Trump and widely supported and reaffirmed by the Biden administration place a 25% tariff on Chinese (among other) steel (&amp; 10% tariffs on aluminum) imports.  This has definitely already curtailed imports, driven prices up and spurred an expansion in U.S. steel making capacity.  

BTW, Taiwan has historically and  consistently considered itself independent from Taiwan.  US has a long history of selling Taiwan arms to protect itself against China and would likely intervene to support Taiwan in the case of an actionable threat.

Add the ability to sell covered calls and you're just winning,l.

 Example
 you think its worth 60 but its trading at 30 then sell a year or more out because calls that otm with short dates would be worth almost nothing. 
But if the difference is small such as it's at 50 and worth 60 then a month long covered call would be decent.

Keep in mind the market usually over reacts so selling short dated has the potential to miss out on the over reaction such as the price going from 50 to 75 meanwhile it stays there and you get assigned missing out on 15, and eventually a few days or even months later it corrects back to its fair value of 60.",0

So if it is a survey of 18-29 year olds, 27% implies the average age of a first time is somewhere around 21ish. Sounds about right and not really alarming.

Fake edit: Hold on. Actually, if we take the wording literally, it's not about ""virgins"" at all. People who had sex at 17, and then didn't have it again until they were surveyed, would technically be lumped into the ""zero partners since 18"" crowd.

Oh also, it's not ""zero partners,"" it's ""zero *female* partners."" So we're putting sexually active gay men into that ""virgin"" bucket too.

The title explicitly says virginity however, so I'm a bit confused about what the chart thinks it's reporting. Either the title or the description is badly misrepresenting the data, they don't sync up.

What I can tell you is that FUBO is in SERIOUS trouble in the competitive landscape. Its only true edge is sports which is why I switched to it from Sling. Since that time most other streaming services have added more sports channels and while not necessarily on par with Fubo, it is enough for most people. 

Personally switching to Hulu was a breath of fresh air because of the huge amount of additional content available. Looking back, I wish I had switched sooner. Sling is significantly cheaper ($29), Fubo is very expensive by comparison ($79), and Hulu has way more content ($71) while also being cheaper.",0

13950,"I disagree. I would have fucked myself if I bought and held. Instead, I've made a lot of money.

""Stocks always go up.""

Sure. But not everyone can hold for an unlimited about of time. Buy and hold works if you invested in 1930 and held until now not everyone is 90. And some people need money in a timeline that's less than 20 years.

""buy and hold"" also doesn't work when companies go bankrupt. If you bought and held world.com, you'd be looking at things differently. People hear about big wins. Big losses aren't as public and aren't talked about.

My biggest issue with buy and hold is that it's a simplistic way of trading that costs you money. 

There's a big pride in being a bull (I guess because it's seen as brave or resolute?) but it's just silly to trade in one way all the time while in an ever changing market.

The NASDAQ has had more down days than up days over its history. If you're only making money on half the days, that's a lot of lost profit left on the table. 

People don't look at it that way. They see lost profit from when they sold when they should've held because that's easy to see. They don't consider how much they could have made in a bear market by taking advantage of it. 

I sold off everything and bought inverse index ETFs right before the market correction. Since then, I have repeated that - buying and selling stocks and ETFs. And I've also had weeks where I purchased regular index ETFs (like the end of last week).

My portfolio has grown 20% in 2021 while a lot of people are bleeding.

If I'd held my stocks (and they are all good, solid companies bought at reasonable prices), I would have screwed myself. Now I own them again but I own more shares and they have a bigger upside than they did when I owned them before.",0

At the end of the day, a stock is only as valuable as what people are willing to pay. The company may still be profitable and contribute to society The, but people pass it by for whatever reason.

You can see money is flowing out of other stocks like tech and fin stocks and into infrastructure stocks. Industry. Commodities (like steel and concrete).

Biden's next big plan will be announced soon - three trillion to be spent on infrastructure (and likely other things - he may touch on green energy, pot legalization - which would give the country much needed tax revenue and jobs).

It's likely infrastructure stocks will get run up and be overpriced too.

But make no mistake it's coming &amp; yes within 2-3 years will absolutely worthy of big data moniker. OEM does want that data.

I bought a crate of 48 ramen noodle packs for 15 dollars on Amazon. It failed to deliver to my apartment so I just bought another while I waited for my refund. Then both delivered and I had 96 ramen packs sitting on my fridge. As you might suspect, I got tired of chicken ramen very fast, so I improvised. Melt butter in a saucepan, add 1 cup of milk and 2 tablespoons of flour (don't add the flour first it burns on the bottom if you do), and boil at medium heat. Once it's thick, add a few handfuls of shredded mild cheddar cheese and you've got a white cheese sauce. Boil the ramen, throw the chicken packet away, and pour the sauce over once you drain the noodles. Add to that a side of roasted potatoes, red peppers, and sugar snap peas (i just buy a mix) and you've got a great meal!",1

14135," *  Viacom was doing well due to fundamentals and a new streaming service. Asshole, previously convincted of inider trading, hedgefund manager forgets the ""hedge"" part and overleverages himself to the tits with other peoples money, mostly banks, and proceeds to not report his, legally obligated to report, &lt;5% stake in various companies (mostly growth/chinese tech), which is illegal for a reason. Reasons like the possibility to cause a flash crash in certain stocks that he was heavy on when the banks find out about his shitfuckery &amp; margin call his ass. He defaults, which causes the hedgefunds assets to be liquidated. $VIAC was one of the stocks liquidated. The position was so heavy it is caused a domino effect of selling. The sell off was SUPPOSED to be gradual, and was agreed between banks to be as such, but from what I am reading Goldman Sachs just straight dumped their shares all at once in a package bundle, undercutting the previously, more slowly sold by other banks, stock. Fucking over other banks in the process while saving their own asses instead of spreading the hit out over everyone relatively evenly.

As his leveraged bets began to fail last week, more and more of Hwang's brokers demanded additional capital to back his loans, with some declaring him in default by Friday and requiring him to liquidate, triggering the massive block trades. The large off-loading cratered the price of those stocks, which have been bouncy since, as people pile on to the otherwise-confident companies at opportunistic prices creating a seesaw of rises and falls.

Essentially Goldman Sachs and other managers didn't listen to their compliance department and took on an exceptionally risky client because he offered them large commissions, and it blew up.",1

They are a brokerage and they do hire real estate agents, but they work for a flat fee instead of a percentage. It's not a total disruption of the agent-based system, but I think they may be successful because of that. The trouble with our system is that most buyers want to use an agent - they need help with the whole process and are convinced it doesn't cost them anything because the seller pays the agent fees (even though that comes out of the money the buyer pays for the house). Real estate agents like to protect their own, so they don't like showing buyers houses that are not listed by an agent.

KW gets around that by being cheap agents /shrug",0

COST - makes their money from membership activity, not necessarily the merchandise.  The only other large retailer that can compete is Sam's (WMT)

PYPL - Payments can be tricky, their acquisitions have helped.  In addition, the remittance area is pretty strong.  I wouldn't buy, but have plenty from 2015 myself, slowly liquidating (down to about $200,000 currently).  Haven't seen their tech stack in a few years but based upon the pace of change, not seeing them make major strides. 

TGT - Not seeing major tail winds to provide support.  Went with a WMT play last year that didn't pay off.

FB - Hiring but their antics during the 2020 election has me not returning the calls of their recruiter.  Good technological stack though.  In other words, they're not going to pay me enough...

DIS - Got hit hard with COVID, especially with the park being shut down in CA, and then there is the cruise line fiasco that is coming down as well.

HD / LOW - Good plays, typically after a disaster when people are buying up wood and hurricane supplies to rebuild.  Come summer, expect to see generators still being sold as CA shuts down their power grid again.

NFLX - Tough to call.  Had contacts with people who went to work there and they said it's brutal internally.  That of course drives innovation and change as people want to keep their jobs.  However, AMZN and HBO are moving in that direction as well.

NVDA and AMD are chip makers.  I'm also looking out for $500 NVDA but leery about the chip / supply shortage (Suez included) forcing NVDA to release video cards which are hobbled.  Huge backlog for RTX 3080 / 3090 since the release of November.

I do not see anything stopping an AMZN juggernaut in the future.  They're not embroiled in the Section 230 censorship issue, and have broadened into many areas the same way that MSFT has as well.  Not even calls for the break up of them as part of a monopoly discussion as we had with MSFT in the past.

15064,"I think the definition of a meme stock has been blurred a little bit. To me it's when people have no idea what they are doing but ""like the stock"" and are buying based on hype instead of fundamentals.

There are companies that are good buys that have become meme stocks, and adversely there are super crap companies that have become meme stocks.

I saw someone mention AMD as a meme stock just a moment ago. AMD is a long term hold that is already profitable, not exactly a meme stock imo. 

Gamestop is definitely a meme stock. They are at least ten years late to the game and they have paid the price for it. I'd love to see them turn it around, but they are now competing directly with the console manufacturers as well as first movers such as Newegg. 

I wouldn't call BB a meme stock, but definitely a little bit of a gamble on if they can pull off the software turnaround long term. (I have a small allocation to BB).

Sadly Tesla is a meme stock. Great company that will hopefully be around long term, but horrendously overvalued for current metrics. Don't get me started on ARKs thesis on Tesla, it shows a fundamental lack of understanding of how many aspects of the company work (or can work), as well as showing that Cathie has maybe lost touch with reality just a tad. I'd really love to buy in to Tesla but it's just too high of a valuation.

Speculation is dangerous. When you see people saying ""I'm new, BUT... ___ is a no brainer""... kind of a sign that it will end up badly. Understand that a lot of the people pumping meme stocks have not-a-clue what they are doing.

I personally don’t believe Covid will be as much of a factor this summer/fall, and people don’t usually buy new RVs every year (or even close to it) so I imagine they sold a lot to the people who would’ve bought one last year. No way to match those comps, especially cuz a lot of families who bought one just cuz of Covid will dump them on the resale market this year. 

I think RVs had the best year they’ll have in a while last year. I love RVing, but the number of new people buying/using them was staggering and I personally feel it was unsustainable.

15329,"Oh where to begin... It's a combination of poor capitalization post-GFC, local market fragmentation, poor macroeconomic environment across the EU, and consequently ultra-low interest rate (low spread earned on assets) that's killing nearly all European banks. 

Like most other industries, winners tend to take more and more. With US banks topping league tables in most European institutional businesses, many European banks (other than a few like DB, Barclays, BNP etc.) have basically retrenched to doing 'boring' loan/spread business due to a lack of scale and technological investment to sustain their institutional/corporate business. (RBS is probably the best example of shutting down most of their capital market / IB business post-GFC through endless restructurings). 

This is also where the macro factor comes in. As some of these banks basically turning into traditional savings &amp; loans bank, imagining making 75bps on a 5-year commercial loan due to low-rate environment across the EU, only to see the country go into another recession (hello Spain, Italy) and the bank having to write off \~5% or more of its book due to default -&gt; you are risking \~5% of your capital to earn 75bps spread -&gt; bad business model. 

Long-term upside is only realistic if there is a sustained period of economic growth (not the central bank printing induced type) that allows these banks to earn a higher spread (steeper EUR curve), face lower prospective credit defaults so they can repair their balance sheet. Otherwise they remain highly levered to the macroeconomic environment of the specific country / broader EU, and that means a lot of risk premium when discounting any future expected earnings...",0

I assume you're an average novice young investor since you seem to post to r/gme a lot, so I would recommend Josh Brown's [book](https://www.amazon.com/How-Invest-My-Money-Finance/dp/0857198084) for you to think about how to invest. (Most people shouldn't be managing thier own account and choosing stocks.)

If you really want to start to understand fundemental analysis I would recommend Phil Fisher's books ([best one](https://www.amazon.com/Common-Stocks-Uncommon-Profits-Writings/dp/0471445509/ref=mp_s_a_1_3?dchild=1&amp;keywords=common+stocks+and+uncommon+profits+by+philip+fisher&amp;qid=1616890944&amp;sprefix=uncommon+profits&amp;sr=8-3) and [another one with both books combined](https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B008847LKW/ref=dbs_a_w_dp_b008847lkw)). A video to watch is something like [this](https://youtu.be/oMmocnLnVgQ) is good to understand the investing mindset at a cursory level.

If after that you think it is something you want to continue to doon your own, then you can easily find other recommendations on here that are more complex and deal more directly with valaution.

However, on downturns, it would be nice to have a strategy to profit in medium term, on same stock/portfolio type because that's what I'm most in tune with.

Playing with anything else would be truly speculation because I don't understand cyclicals that well and low-volatility indexes for me are boooring and low return long term.

Just found the SQQQ. As QQQ decreased 10% between Feb 12 2021 to March 8 2021, the SQQQ increased by 37%.

If you're buying a profitable company that continues growing profits...then the stock price shouldn't matter. Even if it's trading at half of it's fair value, a profitable company will be returning its profits to shareholders with either dividends or share buybacks. And if the stock price still stays stagnant...well...enjoy your 20% dividends or whatever (because a stock with sustainable 20% dividends is absolutely underpriced). 

I think a lot of investors lose sight of this and get caught in trading and speculation.

Inefficiencies exists but they are hard to accurately spot. The market is heavily influenced by emotions and bias, popular stocks might be ""safer"" because they become a self fulfilling prophecy.

You may find an undervalued stock and yet the market can ignore it for long period of times because the allocation of resources still favors something more popular at the moment.

15479,"A couple things I have been thinking about. 

A rip your face off rally would turn me more bearish. Let's say we print 4100 on the SPX next week and NDX makes it way back up to gap fill around 13800, along with spikes down in volatility. You might even see a nice double top forming up in the RUT. This is end of quarter this week so I would think we'll see more of the trend which is throw tech out the window and buy HD, IBM and other mega cap leaders making a rip your face rally unworkable. Grind higher, falling yields, falling dollar and no more dislocations to the downside in commodities would make me more bullish.

I think a lot of this week will come down to that stupid boat stuck in the Suez Canal. It doesn't matter until it does and if that thing is stuck where it will be there for weeks, that is going to start sending some shockwaves. The hedge fund that blew up on VIAC is bothersome. Hopefully the selling is done and the blast is contained. How many more Bill Hwang's are out there levered up x5 with 'billions under management' and about to get a call from the margin clerk?

When you are on reddit, you only see Retail investors investing most their money on tech sector but when you look at these hedge funds they own a lot of these value stocks. Most of Retail investors don't have a diversified portfolio are heavily invested into tech. As a retail investor when you only have $5k to invest in lets say, its much more juicer to invest in tech. You also have to remember that a lot of stock valuation is based on the potential future of the company. KO, for example doesn't have same growth anymore if they did they probably wouldn't be paying dividends like all the other growth stocks. When you are talking about dividend stocks don't forget about the dividends. If you have T($30) for example that pays $2 every year in dividends, you have increased your value by $2. The bare minimum goal of investing is to be inflation. With inflation at 1.5% and T dividend yield at 7% you are beating inflation. It doesn't look at much when you own 10 of these stocks but as a hedge fund that owns 1,000,0000 KO stock that dividends adds a lot.  These value stocks aren't losing money. I think you are looking at the charts wrong. KO was at $60 in 2020 before coronavirus crashed the market. 6 Months ago KO was around $49.30 now it is at $53. Don't forget that tech is the future that's why its always hot but Value stocks will always have a placed in investor's portfolios.",0

Hired a photograph for $500 and paid $1.500 for marketing and a open house with some catering. It’s not harder to sell a more expensive house (only if you go up the the multimillion dollar houses, but thats a different story), so the percantage fee makes no sence. The 30 hours would make a hourly wage of $2.000 dollars an hour if it was the US.

That would be literally WW3 and then NATO would get dragged in unwillingly as well. That's a *baaaaaaaaad* situation for all of humanity. Would... be absolutely terrible.

What I could see China doing is forcing its population into cities, pumping the education and automation in it's own nation, and pushing for unilateral trade agreements and initiatives like the belt/road for food and medical supplies with poorer nations. Seems like the only way they calm an impending demographic and economic crisis with the tools they have available.

If they liberalize their real estate market, it crashes, which is where most of their retirees money is kept so they can't do that. They can't liberalize tech rules to much either, as foreign tech companies tend to be larger, more established world wide and have better global infrastructure.

Their best best, from my slightly educated guess would be to focus on mid-tier manufacturing (cars, phones, modern farm equipment etc) and automation so they can support their aging population while still bumping up GDP per capita.

VIX also crashed to under 19 on Friday its lowest level in over a year. Not really bullish or bearish but another thing to keep an eye on. Bulls hope it is sign that things are getting back to normal and stocks will continue to go up but the bear case would be a major top is forming is VIX is putting in a major bottom here. I also saw retail investor sentiment is at a year high.

Also watching the 10 yr yield and dollar. Both are still trending higher and if this continues it will surely influence equities / commodities. Oil, cotton, PM's are a bit troubling. None of them have been projecting surging demand or inflation recently.

The difference between CCL and some company like Hertz is that Hertz didn't own their cars - so when it came time for adjudication, shareholders got completely shafted. Now, what that would look like in the _actual practice_ is anyone's guess - shareholders are always last in line - but those cruise liners are giant assets. 

Realistically, if CCL was doing that poorly, they likely wouldn't go bankrupt, they'd likely get bought out by someone who _isn't_ doing poorly who is looking to swallow up other sectors. Think, DIS.

A tech company can also be a value company.

Apple also follows some of the traditional aspects of value investing. It is a fairly simple company, someone can easily explain how Apple makes its money.

Each dark pool sponsor has a different quantity queuing and price setting process, but because it is off exchange, the participant doesn't have to show their entire stair-step bid or ask sequence.

For example, many dark pools will close transactions based on mid of best bid-ask on the open exchanges, and exchange quantity up to the available amount in the queues.  So, in essence, the dark pools accept the price discovery of the public exchange, but as a tradeoff all desired quantities may not clear.

I'm not sure what you mean about fundamentals in this context, but a dark pool is just a different way of clearing a market.  And it functions because of the demand of large institutions for this service.

15967,"Warren's philosophy revolves around value investing and buying what you know. Warren doesn't know tech, and he knows that he doesn't.

Investing is all about risk management; how much risk are you taking on for a realistic reward? What happens if you lose a large portion of your money? I personally don't want to spend an extra five to ten years not retired because of a stupid mistake trying to double my money.

It's not as simple as buying Apple or Microsoft and earning 30% average per year. There were many years where they traded sideways or downwards. Look at Microsoft from 2001 to 2014. Thirteen years of doodoo in terms of equity appreciation. It can happen again.

Many of the companies you see popularized today will not be around in 5 to 10 years. For some reason it is popular to lose money and then try to go public.

I wouldn't hesitate to call myself a value investor. One of my ""top"" holdings is eBay. I don't expect for eBay to 10x overnight, but I do believe that it is fundamentally undervalued, and that it is an e-commerce/tech company that pays a dividend. I'll probably still be holding this company in 10 years, and my dividend yield on cost should be pretty juicy at that point, so long as they continue to up the dividend. eBay is also relatively recession proof, as people will continue to buy and sell on their platform no matter what the economy looks like, which brings risk down.

I'm long MSFT, AAPL and EBAY.

The price of the larger companies you mentioned has a lot to do with how much money they are making. IBM is still a fantastic company, but they don't raise their earnings by much. They have quite a bit of debt based on a quick look at finviz, and their dividend payout ratio looks like it is 103%, which is a little ""uh-oh"", as it means they are paying out more than they can afford to, putting their dividend at risk.

There are lots of value plays out there. I think Utz is a good value. WMT or TGT are arguably value companies.

15975,"Anyone out there think that an app where you make an account, and then it provides you a clean UI that almost acts as a ""diary"" for your trades and general market ideas, could be a good idea?

You can connect your other social media follow other traders and it shows up in a Twitter-like feed, but less noisey, and not meant as much for likes/comments/retweet-type-features but more for having something you can point to as a cleaner ""record"" of your thoughts as a trader in chronological order - be it actually trade ideas/alerts or just general musings on stocks etc.. Can also opt-in for e-mail alerts to be notified when a trader you follow posts a new ""note.""

I have accounts on Reddit, Twitter (FinTwit &gt; all other twitter), Discord etc. and follow traders everywhere. Like these platforms but only problem I encounter (as a ""somewhat serious"" trader) is nothing is linear and you can't really track anyone's ideas coherently. Maybe no one gives a shit about this or desires this besides me, but that's what I'm posting to find out.

Reddit is ruled by the ""Hot"" algo, which is great for memes and loss porn and stuff but not for the use case I'm talking about, Discord is like reddit on meth, and Twitter is fun af but between all the RTs and non-trading related content you can't actually scroll through any financial person's feed and get a REAL sense of their deal/history. Half of their feed is Retweets, and stuff that has nothing to do with finance (cat memes and shit). Also I feel like there's a slight accountability problem - like there's not a seamless way to tell the consistent people from the inconsistent people. Like there are legends on this thread who are more consistent than others but it's tough to distinguish them from others who get lucky ONCE but then you dig through their post history and see they're mostly batshit.

I'm trying to figure out whether it's just something I PERSONALLY would like, as someone who is kind of a nerd and likes taking things more seriously, and getting at the actual reasoning behind successful macro traders (in a clean, minimal, simple interface), and holding ppl a bit more accountable, or if this is something that other people crave as well.

I think it's niche and don't think this would be the ""next big thing"" in trading world, rather only attract a slice of the trading/investing world who care more about credibility and consistency vs. the good ole blind YOLO, but I'm trying to gauge whether there could be enough interest for me to devote like all my evenings after my day job building this thing, or if I should move on to another idea.",0

Now give the rest to a professional to invest for you in a low risk posture for at least 80% of the funds. You can use the interest made at the end of each year to set aside to make the following year’s student loan payments.

The ""why"" is a problem here: there is no reason for the match. Using that formula as a predictor of future performance to guide your investing activity would be foolish. However, if you can identify reasons why traders might like or dislike a stock under particular conditions of economy, trade, technological change or other circumstances, and work out a method to factor all that into a predictive system, and it seems to work, then you have a reason why it works so it's probably fine. But then you should be able to validate your approach by applying to other stock and confirm that it's not a fluke. If it works in general then you got something.

But the signal was mixed so I drew another card which was a 4. This was an even weaker card but if the next card was 2 that would make 42 which is super bullish.

If you want to know more I suggest you just start researching, most of the information is out there that lets you connect the dots but it isn't all put together in one spot.

You'll realize that all these billionaires are actually crooks and it will make sense that there is no fucking way to get a billion dollars without manipulation. You'll realize, once you start listening to them that most of them are psychopaths/sociopaths(They think they are the only ones capable of solving the worlds problems, but you'll realize when you look in it that they are the ones that have created the problems).",1

It also has an unusual ownership structure wherein it is owned by fund shareholders, somewhat similar to a credit union. Other brokerages, notably Fidelity and Schwab, eventually lowered their fees to compete when they got tired of losing clients to Vanguard. In short, people invest with Vanguard because it has long offered reputable, low-cost index funds and does not face pressure by ownership to jack up its fees.

You might be right, you might also get caught in a dead end.  That's what makes a market.  But if you fall in love with one stock and expect it will perform over the next decade as it has over the last one, you too can find yourself with a company who either quit growing in favor of a new technology (BB a decade ago) or one that's valuation grew way too fast and the actual cash flow has to catch up with it (TSLA, probably).

17123,"This is a pretty complicated question but it's a good one. The simple answer is that they've been lead to believe that this is the way of investing. What gets complicated is examining why they were lead to believe this, why they took on this belief, and why this belief doesn't match reality.

It used to be that the boomer style of investing was the best route to the best gains. A lot of lore has been built up around this (""time in the market beats timing the market"", ""90% of traders can't beat the index"", etc) and this lore was appropriate a long time ago. But things changed.

Why they changed is something for economic history books in the next century. However, I find that [this video](https://altcensored.com/watch?v=OF87sMjYlws) has a pretty good grasp on why boomer mentality doesn't really work anymore. And this video only scratches the surface, it doesn't think about multi-decade low interest environments (it's from 2008) and massive quantitative easing and retail push through apps. Even though it misses many of the things we're facing today, it still has a strong basis in the fundamenta idea that too many dollars are being herded into the market making it weird.

Now, go back to the boomers. They are part of that herding. It's important to keep them corraled and the way to do that is to represent anything other than putting assets under management in some broad index fund is too much risk.

And while Coca Cola has its growth eaten by other cherry picked tickers, the truth is that people near retirement with a lot of money really only need a 3% dividend and 4% growth to maintain their lifestyle. And retirement is often mostly about maintaining a lifestyle. And it can be scary to think that you could be in an Apple but you could also be in an Amiga and that's not good.",0

17280,"I'll attempt to break it down.

Stocks are commonly valued based on their discounted cash flow, specifically tech/growth stocks.

You take companies future projected cash flow, and then reduce it by the discount rate, aka risk-free return aka usually the 10-year treasury bond.

You then come up with the present value of the company.

If the discount rate rises, it will in return lower the present-day value of the company. Some companies that are hyped in the market today aren't expected to cash flow for another 10-15 years, so imagine what a 2 or a 3% treasury bond does to the equation?

This is why for many growth stocks, even a small rise in the discount rate can greatly affect the valuation of a growth company, because that growth company doesn't expect to actually post profits for another decade.

If our stock market was filled with growth companies that are expecting to cash flow within 2-3 years, then there would be a much smaller effect to rising yields, than what we see right now.

One last thing to point out, when these companies do begin to cash flow, it doesn't mean that they would be posting mega bucks from the first quarter. Usually, it takes many more years for cash flow to ramp up as they exit their ""growth"" stage.",0

17390,"For sure. Here's my upvote for such a well-argued bear thesis. 

I disagree, of course, as someone who believes in CRSR long-term. I don't think the PC/streaming/video game culture that flourished during the pandemic will suddenly disappear as we move beyond Covid-19. That culture won't grow as fast as it did while we were all locked up in our homes, but that culture is also now more interwoven into our daily lives than ever before. Look at how many people use or watch Twitch. Think about how popular video games are in broader culture, with movies being made out of the top franchises. I think people are underestimating how popular all of this will remain, even after the pandemic subsides. And CRSR is perfectly suited to take advantage of all this with their industry-leading products. Also, it doesn't hurt that they make gobs of money, already.

No, CRSR is not a blue-chip stock — which I own lots of, the majority of my portfolio — but it legitimately has the chance to double or triple in the next few years, if the bull thesis is correct. I love my blue-chippers — FB, MSFT, PYPL, ETSY, ABBV, CVX, etc — but they're not doubling in that timeframe. In a well-diversified portfolio, you want companies that are potential doubles and triples like CRSR, in addition to your base of blue chippers.",0

Your optimism bias shows in the lifespan thing you said as well as this bit.

The 1st world has exploited the 3rd world forever, and willingly, take away their natural resources etc. That's not killing them directly but the consequences are there for all to be seen.

Plus when the foreign aid concept was introduced parties which try to move it above 0% of GDP into the 1 or 2% territory crash and burn losing double digits points in approval rating compared to the prior poll.

You ask people in the streets of London or NYC and of course they care about 3rd world countries but then they want stuff and are willing to elevate those who bring them the stuff without question asked, even if those people exploited 3rd world countries.

Getting caught out and having to hold on to a blue chip stock with a solid dividend, fundamentals, low volatility and positive future outlook during a broad downward market movement like we're seeing now is a far cry from holding a small to mid cap like Corsair that's only been recently successful to the pandemic, which is now ending.

there's also the fact that the SLR ratio relaxing from when things crashed last year was a 1 year thing that expires in a couple weeks, and the expectation is that jpow isn't going to announce an extension today (and will ultimately just let it expire)

“Growth” stocks I’m considering to be stocks that are high growth/high risk like Tesla and ARK types. “Value” stocks, like you said, would be more established companies that are more stable. So they will have lower risk but the rate of growth won’t be as high.

Everyone is talking about clean energy, means it’s hype and there are more downside than the upside. Bc there are more sellers than the buyers. Clean energy sounds all great and that should be the future, but check the links i attach;

https://www.chemistryworld.com/opinion/solving-solar-panel-waste-highlights-the-need-for-sustainable-thinking/4013322.article

So, when you check 13F on billionaires, i don’t see any one actually investing on clean energy stock. But they are the PIPE investors. For example, Bill gates, he invested on multiple clean energy related companies including Nuclear fusion. 
When u check his 13F, biggest holding is BRK, bc Buffett donated to Gates foundation. 2nd holding is WM. 
FIRST article, BRK owns wind turbine blade company, and WM is taking care of the Blades that is done with their life span. 

So forget the clean energy, buy WM, and whatever you will be comfortable to hold for 5-10yrs.

17775,"&gt; Yeah and the software quality of german automotives is also steady improving.

Not really. My dad has a brand new Audi Q8 and the software is horrendous. As someone who works in software myself, I simply cannot fathom how a company as big as Audi managed to fuck up the most basic software aspects so heavily. Additionally, the ID3 was heavily delayed and now being recalled due to software issues. German management is notoriously opposed to scrum methodologies, which is essential for software production. It'll take them 10 years if not more to change the entire company culture and catch up to modern tech companies like Tesla.

&gt; If you compare tesla production quality to german production quality the gap is massive.

Not on the Model Y, and that's not even being built with the latest technology that will be installed in Berlin and Texas.

&gt; Design wise tesla is really lacking. The model 3 looks shit imho. Model S is okay I guess.

That's personal. I love the look of the Model 3 and like the Model Y even more. I think only the Model X is ugly, but some people love that one. You also shouldn't discount the fact that Teslas look the way they look because they're more energy efficient that way, which is way more important in EVs than ICE cars.

""A wash sale occurs when an investor sells or trades a security at a loss, and within 30 days before or after, buys another one that is substantially similar""

I read it as - I closed at loss, than I bought it again within 30 days - then it is wash sale. Nothing is said about - I closed at a profit, then bought again cheaper, but still might take it as a loss at some point.

* Macro trends tend to be more useful yet I haven't found anyone offering longer term analysis.
* Related to above, I haven't found anyone offering correlation analysis - sentiment compared to volume, price, short interest, or as a function of company news (earnings reports, hiring/firing announcements, insider transactions, etc).

Why is this not as bad as people think? Because they are not restating their revenue and sales numbers. If they had to restate on how they are recording sales, then that would be a huge issue. Luckily here is just related to their treatment of some of their expenses and liabilities so it shouldn't affect their continued outlook on revenue targets in the future.

17931,I think the problem is that they have to do what they can to avoid moving the price too much. The point at which you are moving the price isn’t related to how large your fund is. So there is kind of an upper limit on the dollar value of what you can buy at once. So when you are small you can pick up a position that is 5 percent of your portfolio so when it doubles in price you get a solid return. That same position if you are big could be .05% of your fund.

My view is that on the back of the EV hype (see recent announcements from VW CEO) there has been a lot of retail buying from the U.S into the ADR, which was reversed onto the thinly traded VOW pushing up its price well beyond VOW3. I can't see the short interest in VOW from bbg but someone is getting squeezed for sure.

To that point, the 5% dividend could be paid for YEARS even if UWMC didn't make a single penny in that time. I'd expect an increase in the dividend by the end of the year because the company IS making money. Lots of it, in fact, as they are increasing revenue double digits each quarter as the operations are streamlined and Q12020 will be yuuuuuge. Even their ""lowered guidance"" of 20-30% revenue growth for Q2 based on rising rates isn't exactly bad news. They close mortgages in ONE THIRD the time that Rocket does in a market where houses are selling above asking price within days.

I'll try to be as brief as possible. It seems like the hedge funds simply keep shorting GME over and over again to try to cover, thereby digging themselves into a deeper hole (using a credit card to pay off another credit card). This normally would end in disaster once your credit runs out. But – will their credit ever run out? Since it seems they can short the same stocks – wether naked or real – as many times as they want, can they just keep doing that indefinitely if they want?

Unless GME does a stock recall, wherein they're supposedly screwed, right? But I've been thinking: how do us retail investors know that we're holding 'real' shares? What if shares we bought are counterfeit? And on top of that there's Cede and Co, who actually own the stocks while we just 'license' them, so couldn't they just decide that the hedge funds have the real stocks while us suckers actually have the fake ones and screw us over that way?",0

Before you get your panties in a bunch about a company making use of a taxpayer subsidy ask yourself the basic civics / economics 101 question: What is a taxpayer subsidy? 

The answer: A taxpayer subsidy is one of the leavers a government has manipulate the market to act according to the \*government's\* will. Tesla taking subsidies for building a plant, and Tesla taking subsidies for selling a car and selling an old one abroad is ***not*** ""not a decent thing to do"" it is directly responding to the very will of the democratically elected government.

&amp;#x200B;

The action you're describing directly increases EV sales in Germany, removing a source of localised air pollution from a city.  Money is being spent by the government to try and achieve this *for Germany*. The free market is responding to this money being spent in exactly the way its designed to.

To think this is somehow not a decent thing to do is profoundly ignorant.",0
19059,"If I understand correctly, some companies depend on the yield because they took on debt with variable interest rates. Short-term rates probably matter more than long term rates. So if the bond yield rises, the interest on their debt goes up too. Might not sound like much when yield goes up a few basis points, but for a company that has to payoff millions upon millions of debt by 2024-2026 it matters a lot. Accordingly the value of their stock should drop because of the inherent risk of not being able to pay back the debt.

&amp;#x200B;

For example in the [10-K of $BLDR](https://investors.bldr.com/node/13351/html) they point out the following:

&gt;As of December 31, 2019, our debt totaled $1,300.0 million, which includes $242.1 million of finance lease and other finance obligations. We also have a $900.0 million revolving credit facility (“2023 facility”), under which we had $27.0 million of outstanding borrowings and $82.2 million of letters of credit outstanding as of December 31, 2019. In addition, we also have $298.6 million in obligations under operating leases.  
&gt;  
&gt;Our substantial debt could have important consequences to us, including:  
&gt;  
&gt;**exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates, and corresponding increased interest expense, because borrowings under the 2023 facility and the $52.0 million senior secured term loan facility due 2024 (“2024 term loan”) are at variable rates of interest;**

19150,Yikes.,0
19151,I'm not in Dell but i'm looking to buy something reasonably stable for my growth portfolio. Dell just seems to go up. Tech sell off? Lol Dell doesn't care. Bonds go up? Dell didn't get the memo. Miss EPS every quarter? Stock goes up again. No news? Let's move up. Am I missing something?,0
19152,No. You have to buy and hold until your shares are worthless,0
19153,"First and most importantly, remind yourself every damn day how much you've accomplished in the last two years.  A lot of people would have given up. You didn't. That matters.  

Instead of looking for investment advice, I'd suggest starting somewhere like Dave Ramsey.  It doesn't sound like you're in debt (which is where he starts), but your money journey can be guided by someone like him.  It's about living frugally and how/when to spend money.   I'm guessing you already have that mostly down, and 3 kids aren't cheap.  But, it will help you keep your mindset of how to manage money rather than letting money/debt/expectations manage you.

Next, focus on making sure your credit is strong.  As a first time homebuyer, that's going to matter more than your down payment.  Clean up any late payments and do whatever you can to make all payments on time.  Learn how credit bureaus work.  All of this matters because there are first time homebuyer programs that allow for $0-3% down.  

So right now, you'll make more money making sure your credit is clean and that you have an emergency fund for expenses than you will doing speculative investing.  That's not going to get you rich quick, but if you can keep your head above water and move forward a little more every day, you'll have a lot of equity in a house by the time those kids are ready to leave the nest and get married, go to college, and be the adults you're raising them to be.

Hang in there, and best of luck on your journey.",0

19288,"That’s rough, and reading the press release reveals that none of that money is going to the company, which makes it worse. At least when a company offers more equity, they raise money that may boost its operations. But here, it looks like a pre-IPO investor is selling out big. They may have been someone who invested early on who has made a boatload with the IPO and is cashing out. 

This is a big risk with IPOs. Most will come with a lockup period (usually 180 days) where original investors can’t sell for a certain number of days. Then that date hits and there’s a lot of profit taking, the shares hit the open market and the stock takes a nosedive. Even worse is when stock options are involved.

“Intel Corporation has been the market share leader for microprocessors for many years. Intel’s market share, margins and significant financial resources enable it to market its products aggressively, to target our customers and our channel partners with special incentives and to influence customers who do business with us. Intel exerts substantial influence over computer manufacturers and their channels of distribution through various brand and other marketing programs. Additionally, Intel is able to drive de facto standards and specifications for x86 microprocessors that could cause us and other companies to have delayed access to such standards. We expect Intel to continue to invest heavily in marketing, research and development, new manufacturing facilities and other technology companies.

Also, Intel has announced that it is developing their own high-end discrete GPUs.”

19366,"Sweden have this problem as well. Unlike Norway where they just removed the VAT on EVs, in Sweden there's still a 25% VAT on EVs, but to make up for it there's a $8,200 cash incentive for buying an EV.

For people EVs still end up being ridiculously expensive, you pay $68k for a base model 3, while in Norway it's $49k. However for companies they don't have to pay the VAT, so now you have a $54k car and you get a $8k incentive on top of that, it's a pretty sweet deal.

The actual number of cars exported really wasn't that many, [https://www.car.info/en-se/stats?from=2017-01&amp;to=2021-03&amp;vd=1.2.3.4&amp;et0=3&amp;tcb=exported&amp;tcs=exported](https://www.car.info/en-se/stats?from=2017-01&amp;to=2021-03&amp;vd=1.2.3.4&amp;et0=3&amp;tcb=exported&amp;tcs=exported)

It still annoyed lawmakers and ""it's the principle of it"" they slapped a 6 month wait period on the incentive so you have to own the car for 6 months, then you get $7k back. This wasn't really enough...because now car dealers just wait 6 months. Last year there was a law proposed which introduced a rule where they will pay out the $8k, but if the car leaves Sweden within 5 years the initial owner will be forced to pay back the incentive, regardless of who is the current owner of the car.

So if you bought an EV and patiently waited half a year to get $8k back, then drove the car for 4 years before selling it to a dealership. If the dealership exports the car without you knowing it, you would be on the hook for $8k. People realized this would a dumb law, so they put it on hold for now.

Still, the entire system is a mess.",0

If I were managing one of those hedge funds I would want to let it kind of do it’s thing Monday, but maintain some level of stability which we saw. 

Establish SSR for Wednesday which happened  yesterday when we saw it dip to 170s. Then bring it back up to a level where retail investors feel comfortable investing stimulus checks with it ending above 200. 

This in my opinion would give a great set up for Wednesday run up, followed by a dip Thursday to once again establish SSR for Friday where then it would be run up to bring the naked calls ITM forcing them to be covered and increasing the price further.

Not ONE reason for the adoption of the tax is to promote a healthy ‘local’ environment OR to distribute the costs to other localities.

In fact, Germany sees an economic advantage as a nation in building out an infrastructure or manufacturing, support, and r+d.

19662,"Interest rates matter, and if they rise high enough there are a few theoretical issues.

1. Bonds become more attractive as an investment because they are a safe way to get a guaranteed return if the yield is high enough. No one wants bonds right now because the yields are abysmal, but if they went up enough people might reconsider.
2. Companies, (speculative growth companies in particular), have had access to basically free debt with interest rates so low which has inflated their values. If they can no longer access free money, they start to look like riskier stocks and people will rotate to safer havens.
3. There are concerns with inflation, and one of the tools to combat inflation is to raise rates. If inflation ends up being bad enough, the Fed may be forced to raise rates to combat it. This could have cascading effects, and typically you would only want to raise rates if the economy is strong enough to handle it. Given the COVID situation, it is unlikely that the economy is all that strong right now (though it might be).

On top of this, there is just a lot of uncertainty in the markets right now. It is unclear how reopening is going to play out and the market rallied to all time highs through a pandemic. It is reasonable to wonder what the next couple of months hold.

Today is Fed Announcement Day, the day we all gather round and listen to old Mr. Powell tell us about how interest rates aren't raising and the Fed will stay the course on its current policy, and all the little boys and girls in Wall Street make believe that he might have said something else.

Expect big swings up and down throughout the day, with the first swing taking us upward at market open, but the greatest swing coming at 2:00 PM.

I'm predicting today will be a red day with a NASDAQ high of 13,616 and low of 13,395.

The next three days will be rocky, but when it's over, we'll know for sure if the correction is over or just beginning. If we end the week above 13,600, we're golden.

19712,"I think you are wrong on a number of counts.

* It is true that how good emission-wise your electric vehicle is depends on what source of energy is used in the power grid, but most of the developed world, Europe included, is moving away from fossil fuels and towards renewable energy. For example I live in an Eastern Europe EU country and renewable energy already compromises a sizeable chunk of the total power generated in my country. And it is only going to get better. Nowadays renewable energy is competitive with fossil fuels for power generation even without subsidies and it is expected to become cheaper which combined with the developments in energy storage will make it the preferred power source.
* Electric vehicles are much, much more efficient that ICE vehicles. As result even when the power grid they are charging uses electricity generated from fossil fuels, the emissions equivalent is still better than most ICE cars. If I recall correctly, even under the worst case scenario (power generated exclusively from coal powered plants with no measures implemented to filter out harmful emissions) they still are comparable to an ICE car with \~40-50 mpg fuel economy.
* Even if the electric grid was sourced almost entirely from fossil fuel plants, the economy of scale and efficiency is still a huge factor - with ICE cars you practically have millions of miniature power plants, whereas with battery powered electric vehicles you have several big power plants, generating power for the electric grid and all vehicles charging off of it. You can imagine which is more efficient.
* It is much, much easier to implement measures to clean the emissions of power plants since they are few in numbers. Moreover, if a country wants to continue to use its fossil fuel power plants, it can upgrade them to be compliant with tighter emission requirements by installing various emission filtration systems. On the other hand it would be impossible to retroactively install better fuel emissions systems on older vehicles - if a vehicle was compliant to EURO 4 for example, you cannot easily convert it to EURO 6.
* The emissions released by ICE vehicles are located within the cities, while power plants are generally located outside of populated neighborhoods or outside of cities altogether. This doesn't matter to the environment but is an important factor for people as it has huge implications for health and quality of life. This is particularly important to Europe due to our high reliance on diesel cars and the particularly harmful emissions diesel engines release, compared to petrol engines.",0

If it goes higher after you sell don't regret, keep in mind what your goal was and that you achieved it and you're trying to make gains in the long run and not through luck. If you reinvest with 10% gain 3 times you're actually up 33% due to compounding interest. If you do it 8 times you've more than doubled your investment.

19982,"Covered calls cap your gains while still exposing you to the same downside risk. The premium is also dependent on how volatile the stock price is, if the stock is **too** stable, then the premium is also going to be really low. Using your AAPL example, let's say you buy 100 shares for $125 and sell a 3/26 130C for $0.94:

1. If the price of AAPL shoots up to $150 at expiration, you're forced to sell at $130, giving up an additional $20/share = $2000.

2. If the price of AAPL drops to $105, you keep the $94 premium, but you lose $20/share = $2000. The +$94 is going to seem like nothing next to the -$2000.

3. Realistically, you're looking at a 10-20% return/year selling options, which sounds pretty nice but you also have to actively manage it. Some ETFs can return that much or more, and all you have to do is buy and hold and check it once a month.

4. It doesn't really give you much protection if the market goes against you, just a band-aid at most. While there's stories of people who turned a losing position into profit by selling CC's, it also ties up a lot of capital in a losing position rather than cutting losses and deploying elsewhere for potentially bigger gains in a shorter amount of time.
